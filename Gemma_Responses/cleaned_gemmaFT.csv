Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ?,"Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.  Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency often becomes evident in the first few days of life. An infant with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have poorly-controlled breathing rate or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder may experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications from ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may include developmental delay and intellectual disability. Progressive liver damage, skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen.  In some affected individuals, signs and symptoms of ornithine transcarbamylase may be less severe, and may not appear until later in life.","Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is a disorder that affects the urea cycle, a series of chemical reactions that removes excess nitrogen from the body. In people with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, the urea cycle is impaired, leading to a buildup of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). Ammonia is a toxic substance that can damage the brain and other organs. The signs and symptoms of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency vary widely, depending on the severity of the disorder. In some cases, the first signs and symptoms appear in infancy, while in others, they may not appear until adulthood. The most common signs and symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and coma. In severe cases, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency can be life-threatening. Treatment for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency typically involves dietary changes and medications to help remove excess ammonia from the body."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) globozoospermia ?,"Globozoospermia is a condition that affects only males. It is characterized by abnormal sperm and leads to an inability to father biological children (infertility).  Normal sperm cells have an oval-shaped head with a cap-like covering called the acrosome. The acrosome contains enzymes that break down the outer membrane of an egg cell, allowing the sperm to fertilize the egg. The sperm cells of males with globozoospermia, however, have a round head and no acrosome. The abnormal sperm are unable to fertilize an egg cell, leading to infertility.","Globozoospermia is a condition in which the sperm cells (spermatozoa) are round or oval in shape instead of having a head and tail. The condition is usually caused by a defect in the acrosome, a cap-like structure on the head of the sperm cell that contains enzymes that help the sperm penetrate the egg. Globozoospermia is associated with male infertility."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) hypochondrogenesis ?,"Hypochondrogenesis is a rare, severe disorder of bone growth. This condition is characterized by a small body, short limbs, and abnormal bone formation (ossification) in the spine and pelvis.  Affected infants have short arms and legs, a small chest with short ribs, and underdeveloped lungs. Bones in the skull develop normally, but the bones of the spine (vertebrae) and pelvis do not harden (ossify) properly. The face appears flat and oval-shaped, with widely spaced eyes, a small chin, and, in some cases, an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate. Individuals with hypochondrogenesis have an enlarged abdomen and may have a condition called hydrops fetalis in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth.  As a result of these serious health problems, some affected fetuses do not survive to term. Infants born with hypochondrogenesis usually die at birth or shortly thereafter from respiratory failure. Babies who live past the newborn period are usually reclassified as having spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a related but milder disorder that similarly affects bone development.","Hypochondrogenesis is a rare disorder that affects the development of cartilage and bone. It is characterized by short limbs, a small head, and a short neck. Other features may include a small chest, a small jaw, and a small nose. Hypochondrogenesis is caused by mutations in the COL2A1 gene."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Macular Degeneration ?,"Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving.     AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.    Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.    NIH: National Eye Institute","Macular degeneration is a disease that affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It is the leading cause of vision loss in people over age 50. There are two types of macular degeneration: dry and wet. Dry macular degeneration is the most common form. It is a slow, progressive disease that causes a gradual loss of central vision. Wet macular degeneration is a more severe form of the disease. It is caused by abnormal blood vessels that grow under the macula and leak blood and fluid. This can cause a rapid loss of vision. There is no cure for macular degeneration, but there are treatments that can slow the progression of the disease."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ?,"Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a disorder in which the immune system produces too many activated immune cells (lymphocytes) called T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and macrophages (histiocytes). Excessive amounts of immune system proteins called cytokines are also produced. This overactivation of the immune system causes fever and damages the liver and spleen, resulting in enlargement of these organs.  Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis also destroys blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, a process called hemophagocytosis. As a result, affected individuals have low numbers of red blood cells (anemia) and a reduction in the number of blood cells involved in clotting (platelets). A reduction in platelets may cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.  The brain may also be affected in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. As a result, affected individuals may experience irritability, delayed closure of the bones of the skull in infants, neck stiffness, abnormal muscle tone, impaired muscle coordination, paralysis, blindness, seizures, and coma. In addition to neurological problems, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can cause abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemia and lymphoma).  Signs and symptoms of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis usually become apparent during infancy, although occasionally they appear later in life. They usually occur when the immune system launches an exaggerated response to an infection, but may also occur in the absence of infection. Without treatment, most people with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis survive only a few months.","Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a rare, inherited disorder that causes the immune system to become overactive. The immune system is the body's defense against infection. In FHL, the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. This attack causes inflammation and damage to the body's organs. FHL is a life-threatening condition. It can cause severe infections, organ failure, and death. There are several types of FHL. The most common type is FHL2. FHL2 is caused by mutations in the PRF1 gene. The PRF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called perforin. Perforin is important for the immune system to fight infections. Mutations in the PRF1 gene cause the immune system to become overactive. This overactivity causes inflammation and damage to the body's organs. FHL2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that both parents must pass on the mutated gene to their child for the child to have the condition."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ?,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a genetic disorder that occurs primarily in males. It mainly affects the nervous system and the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney. In this disorder, the fatty covering (myelin) that insulates nerves in the brain and spinal cord is prone to deterioration (demyelination), which reduces the ability of the nerves to relay information to the brain. In addition, damage to the outer layer of the adrenal glands (adrenal cortex) causes a shortage of certain hormones (adrenocortical insufficiency). Adrenocortical insufficiency may cause weakness, weight loss, skin changes, vomiting, and coma.  There are three distinct types of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy: a childhood cerebral form, an adrenomyeloneuropathy type, and a form called Addison disease only.  Children with the cerebral form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy experience learning and behavioral problems that usually begin between the ages of 4 and 10. Over time the symptoms worsen, and these children may have difficulty reading, writing, understanding speech, and comprehending written material. Additional signs and symptoms of the cerebral form include aggressive behavior, vision problems, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, and impaired adrenal gland function. The rate at which this disorder progresses is variable but can be extremely rapid, often leading to total disability within a few years. The life expectancy of individuals with this type depends on the severity of the signs and symptoms and how quickly the disorder progresses. Individuals with the cerebral form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy usually survive only a few years after symptoms begin but may survive longer with intensive medical support.  Signs and symptoms of the adrenomyeloneuropathy type appear between early adulthood and middle age. Affected individuals develop progressive stiffness and weakness in their legs (paraparesis), experience urinary and genital tract disorders, and often show changes in behavior and thinking ability. Most people with the adrenomyeloneuropathy type also have adrenocortical insufficiency. In some severely affected individuals, damage to the brain and nervous system can lead to early death.  People with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy whose only symptom is adrenocortical insufficiency are said to have the Addison disease only form. In these individuals, adrenocortical insufficiency can begin anytime between childhood and adulthood. However, most affected individuals develop the additional features of the adrenomyeloneuropathy type by the time they reach middle age. The life expectancy of individuals with this form depends on the severity of the signs and symptoms, but typically this is the mildest of the three types.  Rarely, individuals with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy develop multiple features of the disorder in adolescence or early adulthood. In addition to adrenocortical insufficiency, these individuals usually have psychiatric disorders and a loss of intellectual function (dementia). It is unclear whether these individuals have a distinct form of the condition or a variation of one of the previously described types.  For reasons that are unclear, different forms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy can be seen in affected individuals within the same family.","X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands and the nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. The ABCD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the transport of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) across the membranes of cells. VLCFAs are a type of fat that is found in the body's tissues and organs. In people with ALD, the ABCD1 protein is either missing or not functional, which leads to a buildup of VLCFAs in the body. This buildup can damage the adrenal glands and the nervous system, leading to a variety of symptoms. The most common form of ALD is called childhood cerebral ALD, which typically affects boys between the ages of 4 and 10. Symptoms of childhood cerebral ALD include progressive loss of vision, hearing, and speech; difficulty walking and coordination; and behavioral changes. In some cases, the disease can be fatal. There is no cure for ALD, but treatment can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment options include bone marrow transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy, and dietary supplements."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia ?,"Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is a neurological condition characterized by changes to certain areas of the brain. A hallmark of ALSP is leukoencephalopathy, which is the alteration of a type of brain tissue called white matter. White matter consists of nerve fibers (axons) covered by a substance called myelin that insulates and protects them. The axons extend from nerve cells (neurons) and transmit nerve impulses throughout the body. Areas of damage to this brain tissue (white matter lesions) can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Another feature of ALSP is swellings called spheroids in the axons of the brain, which are a sign of axon damage. Also common in ALSP are abnormally pigmented glial cells. Glial cells are specialized brain cells that protect and maintain neurons. Damage to myelin and neurons is thought to contribute to many of the neurological signs and symptoms in people with ALSP.  Symptoms of ALSP usually begin in a person's forties and worsen over time. Personality changes, including depression and a loss of social inhibitions, are among the earliest symptoms of ALSP. Affected individuals may develop memory loss and loss of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies. Loss of this function impairs skills such as impulse control, self-monitoring, and focusing attention appropriately. Some people with ALSP have mild seizures, usually only when the condition begins. As ALSP progresses, it causes a severe decline in thinking and reasoning abilities (dementia).  Over time, motor skills are affected, and people with ALSP may have difficulty walking. Many develop a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, which includes unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), involuntary trembling (tremor), and muscle stiffness (rigidity). The pattern of cognitive and motor problems are variable, even among individuals in the same family, although almost all affected individuals ultimately become unable to walk, speak, and care for themselves.  ALSP was previously thought to be two separate conditions, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD), both of which cause very similar white matter damage and cognitive and movement problems. POLD was thought to be distinguished by the presence of pigmented glial cells and an absence of spheroids; however, people with HDLS can have pigmented cells, too, and people with POLD can have spheroids. HDLS and POLD are now considered to be part of the same disease spectrum, which researchers have recommended calling ALSP.","Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is a rare, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. The disorder is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal structures called spheroids in the brain and spinal cord. Spheroids are abnormal structures that form when the axons of nerve cells become damaged. The accumulation of spheroids leads to the death of nerve cells, which results in the progressive loss of brain and spinal cord function. The symptoms of ALSP typically begin in adulthood and worsen over time. The most common symptoms include progressive weakness, difficulty walking, and problems with balance and coordination. Other symptoms may include difficulty speaking, swallowing, and breathing. The cause of ALSP is unknown, but it is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no cure for ALSP, but treatment is available to help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) hypomyelination and congenital cataract ?,"Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is an inherited condition that affects the nervous system and the eyes. This disease is one of a group of genetic disorders called leukoencephalopathies. Leukoencephalopathies involve abnormalities of the brain's white matter. White matter consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is caused by a reduced ability to form myelin (hypomyelination). Additionally, people with this disorder are typically born with a clouding of the lens (cataract) in both eyes.  People with this condition usually have normal development throughout the first year of life. Development slows around the age of 1. Most affected children learn to walk between the ages of 1 and 2, although they usually need some type of support. Over time they experience muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) in their legs, and many affected people eventually require wheelchair assistance. Weakness in the muscles of the trunk and a progressive abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) further impair walking in some individuals. Most people with hypomyelination and congenital cataract have reduced sensation in their arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy). In addition, affected individuals typically have speech difficulties (dysarthria) and mild to moderate intellectual disability.","Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is a condition that affects the nervous system and the eyes. People with this condition have a reduced amount of myelin, a fatty substance that surrounds and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. Myelin is essential for the normal transmission of nerve impulses. Hypomyelination can cause a variety of neurological problems, including seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. People with hypomyelination and congenital cataract also have cataracts, which are clouding of the lens of the eye. Cataracts can cause vision problems and may require surgery to correct. The cause of hypomyelination and congenital cataract is unknown. It is likely that the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no cure for hypomyelination and congenital cataract, but treatment can help manage symptoms."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Craniopharyngioma ?,"A craniopharyngioma is a slow-growing benign tumor that develops near the pituitary gland (a small endocrine gland at the base of the brain) and the hypothalamus (a small cone-shaped organ connected to the pituitary gland by nerves). This tumor most commonly affects children between 5 and 10 years of age; however, adults can sometimes be affected. Craniopharyngiomas are thought to arise from remnants of the craniopharyngeal duct and/or Rathke cleft or from metaplasia (abnormal transformation of cells) of squamous epithelial cell remnants of the stomadeum.[orphanet] Craniopharyngioma is treated with surgery alone or by surgery followed by radiation.","Craniopharyngioma is a benign tumor that develops from the remnants of the pituitary gland. It is a slow-growing tumor that can cause a variety of symptoms, including headaches, vision problems, and hormonal imbalances. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Tropical Spastic Paraparesis ?,"For several decades the term tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) has been used to describe a chronic and progressive disease of the nervous system that affects adults living in equatorial areas of the world and causes progressive weakness, stiff muscles, muscle spasms, sensory disturbance, and sphincter dysfunction. The cause of TSP was obscure until the mid-1980s, when an important association was established between the human retrovirus  human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 (also known as HTLV-1)  and TSP. TSP is now called HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis or HAM/TSP. The HTLV-1 retrovirus is thought to cause at least 80 percent of the cases of HAM/TSP by impairing the immune system. In addition to neurological symptoms of weakness and muscle stiffness or spasms, in rare cases individuals with HAM/TSP also exhibit uveitis (inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye), arthritis (inflammation of one or more joints), pulmonary lymphocytic alveolitis (inflammation of the lung), polymyositis (an inflammatory muscle disease), keratoconjunctivitis sicca (persistent dryness of the cornea and conjunctiva), and infectious dermatitis (inflammation of the skin). The other serious complication of HTLV-1 infection is the development of adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma. Nervous system and blood-related complications occur only in a very small proportion of infected individuals, while most remain largely without symptoms throughout their lives.
                
The HTLV-1 virus is transmitted person-to-person via infected cells: breast-feeding by mothers who are seropositive (in other words, have high levels of virus antibodies in their blood), sharing infected needles during intravenous drug use, or having sexual relations with a seropositive partner. Less than 2 percent of HTLV-1 seropositive carriers will become HAM/TSP patients.","Tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) is a rare, progressive, neurological disorder that affects the spinal cord. It is characterized by weakness and stiffness in the legs, which may progress to paralysis. The disorder is caused by a virus called the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). The virus is transmitted through blood, semen, and breast milk. There is no cure for TSP, but treatment can help manage symptoms."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Encephalitis lethargica ?,"Encephalitis lethargica is a disease characterized by high fever, headache, double vision, delayed physical and mental response, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and sometimes coma. Patients may also experience abnormal eye movements, upper body weakness, muscule pain, tremors, neck rigidity, and behavioral changes including psychosis. A world-wide epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred from 1917 to 1928. The cause of this condition is unknown, and treatment depends on a person's symptoms. Levodopa and other antiparkinson drugs often produce dramatic responses.","Encephalitis lethargica is a rare neurological disorder that causes inflammation of the brain. It is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, headache, and confusion, followed by a period of lethargy and sleepiness. Other symptoms may include muscle weakness, double vision, and difficulty swallowing. The cause of encephalitis lethargica is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a viral infection. Treatment is supportive and may include medications to reduce inflammation and fever."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E ?,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E (CMT1E) is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which is a group of rare conditions that affect the peripheral nerves. Signs and symptoms of CMT1E generally become apparent between age 5 and 25 years, although the age of onset and disease severity can vary significantly from person to person. In general, CMT1E is associated with the typical features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (progressive weakness of the feet and/or ankles; foot drop; atrophy of muscles below the knee; absent tendon reflexes of upper and lower extremities; and a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and/or lower legs) in addition to hearing loss. CMT1E is caused by certain changes (mutations) in the PMP22 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E (CMT1E) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the peripheral nerves.

The symptoms of CMT1E typically begin in childhood or adolescence and worsen over time. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and improving quality of life."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Shock ?,"Shock happens when not enough blood and oxygen can get to your organs and tissues. It causes very low blood pressure and may be life threatening. It often happens along with a serious injury.     There are several kinds of shock. Hypovolemic shock happens when you lose a lot of blood or fluids. Causes include internal or external bleeding, dehydration, burns, and severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. Septic shock is caused by infections in the bloodstream. A severe allergic reaction can cause anaphylactic shock. An insect bite or sting might cause it. Cardiogenic shock happens when the heart cannot pump blood effectively. This may happen after a heart attack. Neurogenic shock is caused by damage to the nervous system.    Symptoms of shock include       - Confusion or lack of alertness    - Loss of consciousness    - Sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat    - Sweating    - Pale skin    - A weak pulse    - Rapid breathing    - Decreased or no urine output    - Cool hands and feet       Shock is a life-threatening medical emergency and it is important to get help right away.

Although it can be seen in post-menopausal women and very rarely in men, DPL occurs most often in women of childbearing age. Most women with DPL are pregnant, taking the birth control pill, or have uterine leioyomas or estrogen-secreting tumors. Some people with DPL have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms may include abdominal and pelvic pain; rectal or vaginal bleeding; and less commonly constipation.

The symptoms of DPL can include abdominal pain, bloating, and difficulty eating. In some cases, the condition can cause infertility. Treatment for DPL typically involves surgery to remove the leiomyomas."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) microvillus inclusion disease ?,"Microvillus inclusion disease is a condition characterized by chronic, watery, life-threatening diarrhea typically beginning in the first hours to days of life. Rarely, the diarrhea starts around age 3 or 4 months. Food intake increases the frequency of diarrhea.  Microvillus inclusion disease prevents the absorption of nutrients from food during digestion, resulting in malnutrition and dehydration. Affected infants often have difficulty gaining weight and growing at the expected rate (failure to thrive), developmental delay, liver and kidney problems, and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). Some affected individuals develop cholestasis, which is a reduced ability to produce and release a digestive fluid called bile. Cholestasis leads to irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis).  In individuals with microvillus inclusion disease, lifelong nutritional support is needed and given through intravenous feedings (parenteral nutrition). Even with nutritional supplementation, most children with microvillus inclusion disease do not survive beyond childhood.  A variant of microvillus inclusion disease with milder diarrhea often does not require full-time parenteral nutrition. Individuals with the variant type frequently live past childhood.","Microvillus inclusion disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects the small intestine. It is characterized by the presence of abnormal inclusions in the microvilli of the small intestine, which are finger-like projections that help absorb nutrients from food. These inclusions are made up of proteins and other substances that are normally found in the microvilli. The disease is caused by mutations in the MYO5B gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called myosin-Vb. This protein is involved in the movement of substances within the cell, including the movement of proteins and other substances into the microvilli. Mutations in the MYO5B gene disrupt the normal function of myosin-Vb, leading to the accumulation of abnormal inclusions in the microvilli. Microvillus inclusion disease can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, weight loss, and failure to thrive in infants. It can also lead to malabsorption of nutrients, which can cause growth problems and other health issues. Treatment for microvillus inclusion disease typically involves a combination of dietary changes, medications, and nutritional supplements to help manage symptoms and improve absorption of nutrients."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ?,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a cancer of the kidney.  The name ""clear cell"" refers to the appearance of the cancer cells when viewed with a microscope.[5258]  Clear cell renal cell carcinoma occurs when cells in the kidney quickly increase in number, creating a lump (mass).  Though the exact cause of clear cell renal cell carcinoma is unknown, smoking, the excessive use of certain medications, and several genetic predisposition conditions (such as von Hippel Lindau syndrome) may contribute to the development of this type of cancer.  Treatment often begins with surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible, and may be followed by radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, or targeted therapy.","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that is characterized by the presence of clear cells in the tumor. These cells are filled with fat and have a clear appearance under a microscope. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer and accounts for about 75% of all cases. It is more common in men than in women and is more likely to occur in people who are overweight or obese. The cause of clear cell renal cell carcinoma is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to genetic mutations and environmental factors.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) genitopatellar syndrome ?,"Genitopatellar syndrome is a rare condition characterized by genital abnormalities, missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body.  The genital abnormalities in affected males typically include undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and underdevelopment of the scrotum. Affected females can have an enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly) and small labia.  Missing or underdeveloped patellae is the most common skeletal abnormality associated with genitopatellar syndrome. Affected individuals may have additional skeletal problems, including joint deformities (contractures) involving the hips and knees or an inward- and upward-turning foot called a clubfoot. Bone abnormalities of the spine, ribs, collarbone (clavicle), and pelvis have also been reported.  Genitopatellar syndrome is also associated with delayed development and intellectual disability, which are often severe. Affected individuals may have an usually small head (microcephaly) and structural brain abnormalities, including underdeveloped or absent tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum).  People with genitopatellar syndrome may have distinctive facial features such as prominent cheeks and eyes, a nose with a rounded tip or a broad bridge, an unusually small chin (micrognathia) or a chin that protrudes (prognathism), and a narrowing of the head at the temples. Many affected infants have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that leads to breathing and feeding difficulties. The condition can also be associated with abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and teeth.",Genitopatellar syndrome is a rare condition that affects the development of the genitals and the knees. The condition is characterized by a lack of development of the external genitals (hypogenitalism) and a lack of development of the kneecaps (patellae).

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Juvenile Arthritis ?,"Juvenile arthritis (JA) is arthritis that happens in children. It causes joint swelling, pain, stiffness, and loss of motion. It can affect any joint, but is more common in the knees, hands, and feet. In some cases it can affect internal organs as well.    The most common type of JA that children get is juvenile idiopathic arthritis. There are several other forms of arthritis affecting children.    One early sign of JA may be limping in the morning. Symptoms can come and go. Some children have just one or two flare-ups. Others have symptoms that never go away. JA can cause growth problems and eye inflammation in some children.    No one knows exactly what causes JA. Most types are autoimmune disorders. This means that your immune system, which normally helps your body fight infection, attacks your body's own tissues.    JA can be hard to diagnose. Your health care provider may do a physical exam, lab tests, and x-rays. A team of providers usually treats JA. Medicines and physical therapy can help maintain movement and reduce swelling and pain. They may also help prevent and treat complications.

It can also affect other parts of the body, such as the eyes, skin, and heart. There are several types of juvenile arthritis, and each type has its own symptoms and treatment. The most common type is oligoarticular JIA, which affects fewer than five joints. The next most common type is polyarticular JIA, which affects five or more joints. Other types of juvenile arthritis include systemic JIA, psoriatic arthritis, and enthesitis-related arthritis. The symptoms of juvenile arthritis can vary depending on the type of arthritis. However, the most common symptoms are joint pain and swelling. Other symptoms may include fever, fatigue, and weight loss. The cause of juvenile arthritis is unknown. However, it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. This means that"
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) ?,"Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital malformation involving blood and lymph vessels and abnormal growth of soft and bone tissue. Typical symptoms include hemangiomas (abnormal benign growths on the skin consisting of masses of blood vessels) and varicose veins. Fused toes or fingers, or extra toes or fingers, may be present. In some cases, internal bleeding may occur as a result of blood vessel malformations involving organs such as the stomach, rectum, vagina, liver, spleen, bladder, kidneys, lungs, or heart. Individuals are also at risk for blood clots. The cause of the disorder is unknown. A similar port-wine stain disorder in which individuals have vascular anomalies on the face as well as in the brain is Sturge-Weber syndrome. These individuals may experience seizures and mental deficiency. In some cases, features of the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and Sturge-Weber syndrome coincide. Another overlapping condition is the Parkes-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by abnormal connectivity between the arterial and venous system (arteriovenous fistulas).","Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare condition that causes abnormal development of blood vessels, bones, and soft tissues in one or more limbs. The condition is characterized by a large, discolored area of skin (port-wine stain) on the affected limb, a large limb (lymphedema), and an increased number of blood vessels (venous malformations) in the affected limb. KTS is caused by a mutation in the RASA1 gene. The condition is usually diagnosed in childhood and can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or other therapies."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) familial pityriasis rubra pilaris ?,"Familial pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare genetic condition that affects the skin. The name of the condition reflects its major features: The term ""pityriasis"" refers to scaling; ""rubra"" means redness; and ""pilaris"" suggests the involvement of hair follicles in this disorder. Affected individuals have a salmon-colored skin rash covered in fine scales. This rash occurs in patches all over the body, with distinct areas of unaffected skin between the patches. Affected individuals also develop bumps called follicular keratoses that occur around hair follicles. The skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet often becomes thick, hard, and callused, a condition known as palmoplantar keratoderma.  Researchers have distinguished six types of pityriasis rubra pilaris based on the features of the disorder and the age at which signs and symptoms appear. The familial form is usually considered part of type V, which is also known as the atypical juvenile type. People with familial pityriasis rubra pilaris typically have skin abnormalities from birth or early childhood, and these skin problems persist throughout life.","Familial pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare skin condition that is characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin. The patches are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, and scalp. The condition is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Frostbite ?,"Frostbite is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. It most often affects the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, or toes. Frostbite can permanently damage the body, and severe cases can lead to amputation.    Signs of frostbite include       - A white or grayish-yellow skin area    - Skin that feels unusually firm or waxy    - Numbness       If you have symptoms of frostbite, seek medical care. But if immediate medical care isn't available, here are steps to take:       - Get into a warm room as soon as possible.    - Unless absolutely necessary, do not walk on frostbitten feet or toes. Walking increases the damage.    - Put the affected area in warm - not hot - water.    - You can also warm the affected area using body heat. For example, use your armpit to warm frostbitten fingers.     - Don't rub the frostbitten area with snow or massage it at all. This can cause more damage.     - Don't use a heating pad, heat lamp, or the heat of a stove, fireplace, or radiator for warming. Since frostbite makes an area numb, you could burn it.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) oculodentodigital dysplasia ?,"Oculodentodigital dysplasia is a condition that affects many parts of the body, particularly the eyes (oculo-), teeth (dento-), and fingers (digital). Common features in people with this condition are small eyes (microphthalmia) and other eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss. Affected individuals also frequently have tooth abnormalities, such as small or missing teeth, weak enamel, multiple cavities, and early tooth loss. Other common features of this condition include a thin nose and webbing of the skin (syndactyly) between the fourth and fifth fingers.  Less common features of oculodentodigital dysplasia include sparse hair growth (hypotrichosis), brittle nails, an unusual curvature of the fingers (camptodactyly), syndactyly of the toes, small head size (microcephaly), and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Some affected individuals experience neurological problems such as a lack of bladder or bowel control, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), hearing loss, and impaired speech (dysarthria). A few people with oculodentodigital dysplasia also have a skin condition called palmoplantar keratoderma. Palmoplantar keratoderma causes the skin on the palms and the soles of the feet to become thick, scaly, and calloused.  Some features of oculodentodigital dysplasia are evident at birth, while others become apparent with age.","Oculodentodigital dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the eyes, teeth, and bones.

The teeth are also affected, with abnormalities such as missing teeth, small teeth, and malformed teeth. The bones are also affected, with abnormalities such as short stature, short fingers and toes, and abnormalities of the skull and spine. The disorder is caused by mutations in the GJA1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called connexin 43. This protein is involved in the formation of gap junctions, which are channels that allow communication between cells. Mutations in the GJA1 gene disrupt the function of gap junctions, leading to the characteristic features of oculodentodigital dysplasia."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Thanatophoric dysplasia ?,"Thanatophoric dysplasia is a severe skeletal disorder characterized by extremely short limbs and folds of extra skin on the arms and legs. Other features of this condition include a narrow chest, short ribs, underdeveloped lungs, and an enlarged head with a large forehead and prominent, wide-spaced eyes. Most infants with thanatophoric dysplasia are stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure. A few affected individuals have survived into childhood with extensive medical help. Thanatophoric dysplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. While this condition is considered to be autosomal dominant, virtually all cases have occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Two major forms of thanatophoric dysplasia have been described, type I and type II. Type I thanatophoric dysplasia is distinguished by the presence of curved thigh bones and flattened bones of the spine (platyspondyly). Type II thanatophoric dysplasia is characterized by straight thigh bones and a moderate to severe skull abnormality called a cloverleaf skull.","Thanatophoric dysplasia is a genetic disorder that affects the development of bones and cartilage.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?,"Key Points
                    - Intraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.    - Being older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma.    - Signs of intraocular melanoma include blurred vision or a dark spot on the iris.     - Tests that examine the eye are used to help detect (find) and diagnose intraocular melanoma.    - A biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Intraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.
                    Intraocular melanoma begins in the middle of three layers of the wall of the eye. The outer layer includes the white sclera (the ""white of the eye"") and the clear cornea at the front of the eye. The inner layer has a lining of nerve tissue, called the retina, which senses light and sends images along the optic nerve to the brain.   The middle layer, where intraocular melanoma forms, is called the uvea or uveal tract, and has three main parts:         -  Iris  The iris is the colored area at the front of the eye (the ""eye color""). It can be seen through the clear cornea. The pupil is in the center of the iris and it changes size to let more or less light into the eye. Intraocular melanoma of the iris is usually a small tumor that grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body.    -  Ciliary body  The ciliary body is a ring of tissue with muscle fibers that change the size of the pupil and the shape of the lens. It is found behind the iris. Changes in the shape of the lens help the eye focus. The ciliary body also makes the clear fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the iris. Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.      -  Choroid  The choroid is a layer of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the eye. Most intraocular melanomas begin in the choroid. Intraocular melanoma of the choroid is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.          Intraocular melanoma is a rare cancer that forms from cells that make melanin in the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. It is the most common eye cancer in adults.","Intraocular (uveal) melanoma is a cancer that begins in the eye. It is a rare cancer that usually affects adults. It is more common in people with light-colored eyes. Intraocular melanoma is a type of melanoma. Melanoma is a cancer that begins in the cells that make pigment (color) in the skin. Intraocular melanoma is also called uveal melanoma. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. It includes the iris, the colored part of the eye, the choroid, the layer of blood vessels behind the iris, and the ciliary body, which makes fluid for the eye. Intraocular melanoma is the most common type of eye cancer in adults. It is the second most common type of eye cancer in children."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disorder that can cause a variety of neurological problems. People with this condition typically have developmental delay, especially involving speech development; intellectual disability; and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) soon after birth. About half of those affected experience seizures, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), decreased reflexes (hyporeflexia), and behavioral problems. The most common behavioral problems associated with this condition are sleep disturbances, hyperactivity, difficulty maintaining attention, and anxiety. Less frequently, affected individuals may have increased aggression, hallucinations, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and self-injurious behavior, including biting and head banging. People with this condition can also have problems controlling eye movements. Less common features of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency include uncontrollable movements of the limbs (choreoathetosis), involuntary tensing of the muscles (dystonia), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and a progressive worsening of ataxia.","Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare disorder that affects the nervous system. It is characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. People with this condition may also have behavioral problems, such as aggression, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Beriberi ?,"Beriberi is a condition that occurs in people who are deficient in thiamine (vitamin B1). There are two major types of beriberi: wet beriberi which affects the cardiovascular system and dry beriberi which affects the nervous system. People with wet beriberi may experience increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and swelling of the lower legs. Signs and symptoms of dry beriberi include difficulty walking; loss of feeling in the hands and/or feet; paralysis of the lower legs; mental confusion; speech difficulty; pain; and/or vomiting. Beriberi is rare in the United States since many foods are now vitamin enriched; however, alcohol abuse, dialysis and taking high doses of diuretics increases the risk of developing the condition. In most cases, beriberi occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. A rare condition known as genetic beriberi is inherited (passed down through families) and is associated with an inability to absorb thiamine from foods. Treatment generally includes thiamine supplementation, given by injection or taken by mouth.","Beriberi is a disease caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1). It is characterized by weakness, loss of appetite, and abnormal heart action. Beriberi is most common in people who eat a diet consisting mainly of polished rice."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina ?,"Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina, which is often shortened to gyrate atrophy, is an inherited disorder characterized by progressive vision loss. People with this disorder have an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye, and in a nearby tissue layer called the choroid. During childhood, they begin experiencing nearsightedness (myopia), difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness), and loss of side (peripheral) vision. Over time, their field of vision continues to narrow, resulting in tunnel vision. Many people with gyrate atrophy also develop clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts). These progressive vision changes lead to blindness by about the age of 50.  Most people with gyrate atrophy have no symptoms other than vision loss, but some have additional features of the disorder. Occasionally, newborns with gyrate atrophy develop excess ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia), which may lead to poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, or coma. Neonatal hyperammonemia associated with gyrate atrophy generally responds quickly to treatment and does not recur after the newborn period.  Gyrate atrophy usually does not affect intelligence; however, abnormalities may be observed in brain imaging or other neurological testing. In some cases, mild to moderate intellectual disability is associated with gyrate atrophy.  Gyrate atrophy may also cause disturbances in the nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells (peripheral nervous system). In some people with the disorder these abnormalities lead to numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, while in others they are detectable only by electrical testing of the nerve impulses.  In some people with gyrate atrophy, a particular type of muscle fibers (type II fibers) break down over time. While this muscle abnormality usually causes no symptoms, it may result in mild weakness.","Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina is a rare inherited disorder that causes progressive vision loss. The condition is characterized by a gradual loss of the light-sensitive cells (photoreceptors) in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The retina is responsible for converting light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. The loss of photoreceptors leads to a gradual loss of vision. In gyrate atrophy, the loss of photoreceptors is most severe in the central part of the retina (the macula), which is responsible for sharp, central vision. As a result, people with this condition have difficulty seeing fine details and may have trouble reading and recognizing faces. The condition is also characterized by a progressive loss of the choroid, the layer of blood vessels that supplies the retina with oxygen and nutrients. The loss of the choroid leads to a gradual thinning of the retina, which can cause vision loss. Gyrate atrophy is caused by mutations in the ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called ornithine aminotransferase, which is involved in the breakdown of proteins. Mutations in the OAT gene lead to a deficiency of ornithine aminotransferase, which disrupts the breakdown of"
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Shoulder Injuries and Disorders ?,"Your shoulder joint is composed of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone). Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They can also be unstable because the ball of the upper arm is larger than the shoulder socket that holds it. To remain in a stable or normal position, the shoulder must be anchored by muscles, tendons and ligaments. Because the shoulder can be unstable, it is the site of many common problems. They include sprains, strains, dislocations, separations, tendinitis, bursitis, torn rotator cuffs, frozen shoulder, fractures and arthritis.     Usually shoulder problems are treated with RICE. This stands for Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. Other treatments include exercise, medicines to reduce pain and swelling, and surgery if other treatments don't work.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases","The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint. The ball is the head of the upper arm bone (humerus). The socket is the shoulder blade (scapula). The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body. It is also the most unstable. The shoulder is held together by muscles, tendons, and ligaments. The shoulder is covered by a joint capsule. The capsule is lined with a smooth membrane called the synovium. The synovium produces synovial fluid, which lubricates the joint. The shoulder is also covered by a layer of tissue called the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is made up of four muscles and their tendons. The rotator cuff helps to stabilize the shoulder joint."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) methylmalonic acidemia ?,"Methylmalonic acidemia is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to process certain proteins and fats (lipids) properly. The effects of methylmalonic acidemia, which usually appear in early infancy, vary from mild to life-threatening. Affected infants can experience vomiting, dehydration, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental delay, excessive tiredness (lethargy), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Long-term complications can include feeding problems, intellectual disability, chronic kidney disease, and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Without treatment, this disorder can lead to coma and death in some cases.","Methylmalonic acidemia is a disorder that affects the body's ability to break down certain proteins and fats. This disorder is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme called methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. This enzyme is needed to convert a substance called methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which is a molecule that is used to make energy. Without this enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA builds up in the body and is converted to methylmalonic acid. Methylmalonic acid is toxic to the body and can cause serious health problems. Symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia can include vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and coma. Treatment for this disorder typically involves a low-protein diet and supplementation with vitamins and minerals."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Glycogen storage disease type 7 ?,"Glycogen storage disease type 7 (GSD7) is an inherited condition in which the body is unable to break down glycogen (a complex sugar) in the muscle cells. Because glycogen is an important source of energy, this can interfere with the normal functioning of muscle cells. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary, but may include muscle weakness and stiffness; painful muscle cramps; nausea and vomiting; and/or myoglobinuria (the presence of myoglobin in the urine) following moderate to strenuous exercise. Symptoms typically resolve with rest. GSD7 is most commonly diagnosed during childhood; however, some affected people may rarely develop symptoms during infancy or later in adulthood. Those who develop the condition during infancy may experience additional symptoms such as hypotonia (poor muscle tone), cardiomyopathy and breathing difficulties that often lead to a shortened lifespan (less than 1 year). This condition is caused by changes (mutations) in the PFKM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is no specific treatment for GSD7; however, affected people are generally advised to avoid vigorous exercise and high-carbohydrate meals.","Glycogen storage disease type 7 (GSD7) is a rare disorder that affects the liver and muscles. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which is needed to break down glycogen, a storage form of glucose. GSD7 is characterized by low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia), muscle weakness, and an enlarged liver. Symptoms typically appear in infancy or early childhood. Treatment for GSD7 includes a diet high in carbohydrates and frequent feedings to prevent hypoglycemia."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Cogan-Reese syndrome ?,"Cogan-Reese syndrome is one type of Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) syndrome. The ICE syndromes predominantly affect Caucasian, young to middle-aged women, and involve one eye. While there have been some cases of Cogan-Reese syndrome reported in children, the disease is typically observed in females in the mid-adult years. [1] In one study of 71 patients with ICE syndrome, the mean age at diagnosis was 51-years. Known glaucoma was present in 11 (15%) of cases. [2] While it is not yet known how to keep Cogan-Reese syndrome from progressing, the glaucoma associated with the disease can be treated with medication. Additionally, corneal transplant can treat any corneal swelling. The National Eye Institute provides information on screening for glaucoma HERE.","Cogan-Reese syndrome is a rare condition that causes the cornea to become cloudy and the eye to bulge forward. The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. The cornea is the part of the eye that helps focus light onto the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The cornea is normally clear, but in people with Cogan-Reese syndrome, the cornea becomes cloudy and the eye bulges forward. The condition is usually present at birth, but it can also develop in childhood or adulthood. Cogan-Reese syndrome is caused by a mutation in the COL8A2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called collagen type VIII alpha-2 chain. Collagen is a protein that forms the main structural component of connective tissue, which is the tissue that supports and connects other tissues and organs in the body. Collagen type VIII alpha-2 chain is found in the cornea and other tissues. Mutations in the COL8A2 gene prevent the production of collagen type VIII alpha-2 chain, which leads to the development of Cogan-Reese syndrome."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A ?,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is a type of inherited neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. Affected individuals experience weakness and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles of the lower legs beginning in adolescence; later they experience hand weakness and sensory loss. CMT1A is caused by having an extra copy (a duplication) of the PMP22 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment for this condition may include physical therapy; occupational therapy; braces and other orthopedic devices; orthopedic surgery; and pain medications.,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is a genetic disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves are the nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. CMT1A is the most common type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. It is characterized by progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles in the feet and legs, and sometimes in the hands and arms. The weakness and wasting of the muscles can lead to difficulty walking and other mobility problems. CMT1A is caused by a duplication of a small piece of chromosome 17. This duplication causes an extra copy of the gene that makes the protein PMP22. The extra copy of the gene leads to an overproduction of the PMP22 protein, which disrupts the function of the peripheral nerves. CMT1A is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases of CMT1A are inherited from an affected parent, but some cases are caused by new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no family history of the disorder.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Erb-Duchenne and Dejerine-Klumpke Palsies ?,"The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that conducts signals from the spine to the shoulder, arm, and hand. Brachial plexus injuries are caused by damage to those nerves. Erb-Duchenne (Erb's) palsy refers to paralysis of the upper brachial plexus. Dejerine-Klumpke (Klumpke's) palsy refers to paralysis of the lower brachial plexus. Although injuries can occur at any time, many brachial plexus injuries happen when a baby's shoulders become impacted during delivery and the brachial plexus nerves stretch or tear. There are four types of brachial plexus injuries: avulsion, the most severe type, in which the nerve is torn from the spine; rupture, in which the nerve is torn but not at the spinal attachment; neuroma, in which the nerve has torn and healed but scar tissue puts pressure on the injured nerve and prevents it from conducting signals to the muscles; and neuropraxia or stretch, in which the nerve has been damaged but not torn.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Baraitser-Winter syndrome ?,"Baraitser-Winter syndrome is a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body, particularly the face and the brain.  An unusual facial appearance is the most common characteristic of Baraitser-Winter syndrome. Distinctive facial features can include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large eyelid openings, droopy eyelids (ptosis), high-arched eyebrows, a broad nasal bridge and tip of the nose, a long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), full cheeks, and a pointed chin.  Structural brain abnormalities are also present in most people with Baraitser-Winter syndrome. These abnormalities are related to impaired neuronal migration, a process by which nerve cells (neurons) move to their proper positions in the developing brain. The most frequent brain abnormality associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome is pachygyria, which is an area of the brain that has an abnormally smooth surface with fewer folds and grooves. Less commonly, affected individuals have lissencephaly, which is similar to pachygyria but involves the entire brain surface. These structural changes can cause mild to severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures.  Other features of Baraitser-Winter syndrome can include short stature, ear abnormalities and hearing loss, heart defects, presence of an extra (duplicated) thumb, and abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary system.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Head Lice ?,"Head lice are parasitic wingless insects. They live on people's heads and feed on their blood. An adult louse is about the size of a sesame seed. The eggs, called nits, are even smaller - about the size of a knot in thread. Lice and nits are found on or near the scalp, most often at the neckline and behind the ears.    Lice spread by close person-to-person contact. It is possible, but not common, to get lice by sharing personal belongings such as hats or hairbrushes. Children ages 3-11 and their families get head lice most often. Personal hygiene has nothing to do with getting head lice. Head lice do not spread disease.    Symptoms are        - Tickling feeling in the hair    - Frequent itching    - Sores from scratching    - Irritability and difficulty sleeping. Head lice are most active in the dark.       Treatment is recommended for people who have an active infestation of head lice. All household members and other close contacts should be checked and treated if necessary. Some experts also recommend treating anyone who shares a bed with an infested person. It is important to treat everyone at the same time.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Miscarriage ?,"A miscarriage is the loss of pregnancy from natural causes before the 20th week of pregnancy. Most miscarriages occur very early in the pregnancy, often before a woman even knows she is pregnant. There are many different causes for a miscarriage. In most cases, there is nothing you can do to prevent a miscarriage.    Factors that may contribute to miscarriage include       - A genetic problem with the fetus. This is the most common cause in the first trimester.    - Problems with the uterus or cervix. These contribute in the second trimester.    - Polycystic ovary syndrome       Signs of a miscarriage can include vaginal spotting or bleeding, abdominal pain or cramping, and fluid or tissue passing from the vagina. Although vaginal bleeding is a common symptom of miscarriage, many women have spotting early in their pregnancy but do not miscarry. But if you are pregnant and have bleeding or spotting, contact your health care provider immediately.    Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not need any treatment. In some cases, you may need a procedure called a dilatation and curettage (D&C) to remove tissue remaining in the uterus.    Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later, if you do decide to try again, work closely with your health care provider to lower the risks. Many women who have a miscarriage go on to have healthy babies.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",A miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week of pregnancy. It is also called a spontaneous abortion. Most miscarriages happen in the first trimester (the first 3 months of pregnancy). About 10 to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. The chance of miscarriage increases with age.

People with optic atrophy type 1 frequently have problems with color vision that make it difficult or impossible to distinguish between shades of blue and green. Other vision problems associated with this condition include a progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor) of the nerve that relays visual information from the eye to the brain (optic nerve). Optic nerve pallor can be detected during an eye examination.","Optic atrophy type 1 is a condition that affects the eyes. It is characterized by progressive loss of vision (vision loss) and optic nerve atrophy. Optic nerve atrophy is a condition in which the optic nerve, which carries visual information from the eye to the brain, is damaged. The optic nerve is the nerve that connects the eye to the brain. It is responsible for transmitting visual information from the eye to the brain. Optic nerve atrophy can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma, infection, and genetic disorders. In optic atrophy type 1, the optic nerve is damaged due to a mutation in the OPA1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the formation of mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures within cells. Mutations in the OPA1 gene can lead to the production of an abnormal protein that disrupts the function of mitochondria in the optic nerve. This can cause the optic nerve to degenerate and lead to vision loss. Optic atrophy type 1 is a rare condition that affects both males and females.

It can also be acquired (noninherited) and may be brought on by certain medicines and other medical conditions.","Long QT syndrome is a heart condition that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). The condition is caused by a problem with the electrical system of the heart. The heart has a natural electrical system that controls the heartbeat. The electrical system sends electrical signals through the heart to make it beat. In people with long QT syndrome, the electrical signals are abnormal. The signals cause the heart to beat too slowly or too quickly. The condition can cause the heart to stop beating. Long QT syndrome can be inherited or caused by certain medications."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Infectious Arthritis ?,"Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body. Symptoms of infectious arthritis include       - Intense pain in the joint    - Joint redness and swelling    - Chills and fever    - Inability to move the area with the infected joint       One type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. Sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. In women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.    To diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.","Infectious arthritis is an inflammation of the joints caused by an infection. The infection can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The most common cause of infectious arthritis is bacteria. The bacteria can enter the joint through the bloodstream or through a wound.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Skin Pigmentation Disorders ?,"Pigmentation means coloring. Skin pigmentation disorders affect the color of your skin. Your skin gets its color from a pigment called melanin. Special cells in the skin make melanin. When these cells become damaged or unhealthy, it affects melanin production. Some pigmentation disorders affect just patches of skin. Others affect your entire body.     If your body makes too much melanin, your skin gets darker. Pregnancy, Addison's disease, and sun exposure all can make your skin darker. If your body makes too little melanin, your skin gets lighter. Vitiligo is a condition that causes patches of light skin. Albinism is a genetic condition affecting a person's skin. A person with albinism may have no color, lighter than normal skin color, or patchy missing skin color. Infections, blisters and burns can also cause lighter skin.","Skin pigmentation disorders are conditions that affect the color of the skin. The skin's color is determined by the amount of melanin, a pigment produced by cells called melanocytes. Melanin is found in the skin, hair, and eyes. The amount of melanin in the skin determines the color of the skin. People with more melanin have darker skin, while people with less melanin have lighter skin. Skin pigmentation disorders can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, sun exposure, and certain medical conditions. Some skin pigmentation disorders are temporary, while others are permanent."
Answer this question truthfully,"What is (are) blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome ?","Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a condition that mainly affects development of the eyelids. People with this condition have a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and an upward fold of the skin of the lower eyelid near the inner corner of the eye (epicanthus inversus). In addition, there is an increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus). Because of these eyelid abnormalities, the eyelids cannot open fully, and vision may be limited.  Other structures in the eyes and face may be mildly affected by BPES. Affected individuals are at an increased risk of developing vision problems such as nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) beginning in childhood. They may also have eyes that do not point in the same direction (strabismus) or ""lazy eye"" (amblyopia) affecting one or both eyes. People with BPES may also have distinctive facial features including a broad nasal bridge, low-set ears, or a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum).  There are two types of BPES, which are distinguished by their signs and symptoms. Both types I and II include the eyelid malformations and other facial features. Type I is also associated with an early loss of ovarian function (primary ovarian insufficiency) in women, which causes their menstrual periods to become less frequent and eventually stop before age 40. Primary ovarian insufficiency can lead to difficulty conceiving a child (subfertility) or a complete inability to conceive (infertility).","Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a condition that affects the eyes and the development of the reproductive organs. The condition is characterized by a narrowing of the opening of the eyelids (blepharophimosis), drooping of the upper eyelids (ptosis), and a fold of skin on the inner corner of the eye (epicanthus inversus).

Aplasia cutis congenita is usually a benign condition, but it can be associated with other birth defects, such as cleft lip and palate, heart defects, and limb abnormalities."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ?,"Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a progressive disorder that mainly affects the central nervous system (CNS). This disorder causes deterioration of white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin (the substance that protects the nerves). Most affected people begin to have signs and symptoms during childhood, but symptoms may first become apparent anywhere from before birth to adulthood. Symptoms may include difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia); muscle stiffness (spasticity); and optic atrophy. Symptoms may worsen rapidly with episodes of fever, after head trauma, or with other stresses on the body. This disorder may be caused by mutations in any of 5 genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is no specific treatment, and prognosis seems to correlate with the age of onset, the earliest forms being more severe.","Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM) is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the brain. It is characterized by progressive loss of myelin, the fatty substance that surrounds and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. This loss of myelin leads to a breakdown of the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for communication between different parts of the brain. The symptoms of VWM typically begin in childhood and worsen over time. They may include difficulty walking, muscle weakness, speech problems, and cognitive impairment. In some cases, the symptoms may be mild and go unnoticed for many years. However, in other cases, the symptoms can be severe and lead to disability or even death. There is no cure for VWM, but treatment may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Long QT syndrome 1 ?,"Romano-Ward syndrome is the most common form of inherited long QT syndrome. Symptoms include arrhythmia, fainting, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. There are six different types of this syndrome, long QT 1 through 6. Each type is caused by a change in a different gene. The most prevalent form of long QT syndrome is long QT type 1. Long QT type 1 is caused by changes in the KCNQ1 gene. Romano-Ward syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.","Long QT syndrome 1 (LQTS1) is a condition that affects the heart's electrical system. The heart has a natural pacemaker that controls the rate at which the heart beats. The pacemaker sends electrical signals that cause the heart to contract and pump blood. In people with LQTS1, the electrical signals that control the heart's rhythm are abnormal. The heart beats too slowly or too quickly, and the heart's rhythm may be irregular. LQTS1 is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1 gene. The KCNQ1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Kv7.1. This protein is found in the heart and in the brain. It is part of a channel that allows potassium ions to flow into and out of cells. Potassium ions are important for the normal function of the heart and brain. Mutations in the KCNQ1 gene disrupt the function of the Kv7.1 protein, which disrupts the flow of potassium ions. This disruption causes the heart to beat too slowly or too quickly, and the heart's rhythm may be irregular. LQTS1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) combined pituitary hormone deficiency ?,"Combined pituitary hormone deficiency is a condition that causes a shortage (deficiency) of several hormones produced by the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. A lack of these hormones may affect the development of many parts of the body. The first signs of this condition include a failure to grow at the expected rate and short stature that usually becomes apparent in early childhood.  People with combined pituitary hormone deficiency may have hypothyroidism, which is underactivity of the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland in the lower neck. Hypothyroidism can cause many symptoms, including weight gain and fatigue. Other features of combined pituitary hormone deficiency include delayed or absent puberty and lack the ability to have biological children (infertility). The condition can also be associated with a deficiency of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol deficiency can impair the body's immune system, causing individuals to be more susceptible to infection.  Rarely, people with combined pituitary hormone deficiency have intellectual disability; a short, stiff neck; or underdeveloped optic nerves, which carry visual information from the eyes to the brain.","Combined pituitary hormone deficiency is a condition that affects the pituitary gland, which is a small gland located at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland produces hormones that control many functions of the body, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction. In combined pituitary hormone deficiency, the pituitary gland does not produce enough of these hormones. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including short stature, delayed puberty, and infertility. Treatment for combined pituitary hormone deficiency typically involves hormone replacement therapy."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy ?,"If you are pregnant, high blood pressure can cause problems for you and your unborn baby. You may have had high blood pressure before you got pregnant. Or you may get it once you are pregnant - a condition called gestational hypertension. Either one can cause low birth weight or premature delivery of the baby.    Controlling your blood pressure during pregnancy and getting regular prenatal care are important for the health of you and your baby. Treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy may include close monitoring of the baby, lifestyle changes, and certain medicines.    Some pregnant women with high blood pressure develop preeclampsia. It's a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It can be life-threatening for both you and the unborn baby. There is no proven way to prevent it. Most women who have signs of preeclampsia are closely monitored to lessen or avoid complications. The only way to ""cure"" preeclampsia is to deliver the baby.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Holes in the Heart ?,"Holes in the heart are simple congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects. Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. These defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.
                
The heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. With each heartbeat, the right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body.
                
The septum prevents mixing of blood between the two sides of the heart. However, some babies are born with holes in the upper or lower septum.
                
A hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). A hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect (VSD).
                
ASDs and VSDs allow blood to pass from the left side of the heart to the right side. Thus, oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. As a result, some oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the lungs instead of the body.
                
Over the past few decades, the diagnosis and treatment of ASDs and VSDs have greatly improved. Children who have simple congenital heart defects can survive to adulthood. They can live normal, active lives because their heart defects close on their own or have been repaired.","A hole in the heart is a defect in the wall that separates the two upper chambers of the heart (atria) or the two lower chambers (ventricles). The defect is present at birth. The hole is usually small and may close on its own. If the hole does not close, it may need to be repaired."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Familial hyperinsulinism ?,"Familial hyperinsulinism is an inherited condition that causes individuals to have abnormally high levels of insulin, which leads to frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, and/or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as seizures, intellectual disability, breathing difficulties, and/or coma. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur after periods without food (fasting), episodes of hypoglycemia in people with familial hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating or exercising. Mutations in at least seven genes have been found to cause this condition. It is often inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern or less commonly, an autosomal dominant pattern.","Familial hyperinsulinism is a rare disorder that causes low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infants and children. The condition is caused by a defect in the beta cells of the pancreas, which are responsible for producing insulin. In people with familial hyperinsulinism, the beta cells produce too much insulin, which causes the blood sugar level to drop too low. Symptoms of familial hyperinsulinism include irritability, lethargy, seizures, and coma. Treatment for familial hyperinsulinism typically involves a high-protein diet and medications to control blood sugar levels. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected beta cells."

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) cutis laxa ?,"Cutis laxa is a disorder of connective tissue, which is the tissue that forms the body's supportive framework. Connective tissue provides structure and strength to the muscles, joints, organs, and skin.  The term ""cutis laxa"" is Latin for loose or lax skin, and this condition is characterized by skin that is sagging and not stretchy (inelastic). The skin often hangs in loose folds, causing the face and other parts of the body to have a droopy appearance. Extremely wrinkled skin may be particularly noticeable on the neck and in the armpits and groin.  Cutis laxa can also affect connective tissue in other parts of the body, including the heart, blood vessels, joints, intestines, and lungs. The disorder can cause heart problems and abnormal narrowing, bulging, or tearing of critical arteries. Affected individuals may have soft out-pouchings in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia) or around the belly button (umbilical hernia). Pouches called diverticula can also develop in the walls of certain organs, such as the bladder and intestines. During childhood, some people with cutis laxa develop a lung disease called emphysema, which can make it difficult to breathe. Depending on which organs and tissues are affected, the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa can range from mild to life-threatening.  Researchers have described several different forms of cutis laxa. The forms are often distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. In general, the autosomal recessive forms of cutis laxa tend to be more severe than the autosomal dominant form. In addition to the features described above, some people with autosomal recessive cutis laxa have delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, and problems with movement that can worsen over time.  The X-linked form of cutis laxa is often called occipital horn syndrome. This form of the disorder is considered a mild type of Menkes syndrome, which is a condition that affects copper levels in the body. In addition to sagging and inelastic skin, occipital horn syndrome is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose joints.","Cutis laxa is a group of genetic disorders that cause the skin to be loose and wrinkled. The skin may also be thin and fragile. The condition is usually present at birth, but it can also develop later in life. Cutis laxa can affect the skin on the face, neck, arms, legs, and trunk. It can also affect the lungs, heart, and blood vessels. There are several types of cutis laxa, and each type has its own set of symptoms. The most common type is autosomal recessive cutis laxa, which is caused by mutations in the ELN gene. This type of cutis laxa is usually mild and does not cause any serious health problems. However, it can cause the skin to be loose and wrinkled, and it can also cause the lungs to be weak. The second most common type of cutis laxa is autosomal dominant cutis laxa, which is caused by mutations in the FBLN5 gene. This type of cutis laxa is usually more severe than autosomal recessive cutis laxa, and it can cause the skin to be loose and wrinkled, the lungs to be weak, and the heart to be enlarged. The third type of cutis laxa is X-linked"
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD deficiency) is an inborn error of valine (an amino acid) metabolism. The symptoms, which may not develop until later in infancy or childhood, can include failure to thrive, dilated cardiomyopathy, seizures, and anemia. IBD deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACAD8 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.","Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare disorder that affects the body's ability to break down certain proteins. This condition is caused by mutations in the ACAD9 gene. The ACAD9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This protein is involved in the breakdown of certain amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. The breakdown of amino acids is an important process that provides energy for the body and helps to remove waste products. Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is characterized by a buildup of isobutyryl-CoA, a molecule that is produced during the breakdown of certain amino acids. This buildup can lead to a variety of symptoms, including seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. In some cases, the condition can also cause liver and kidney problems. Treatment for isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency typically involves a low-protein diet and supplementation with certain vitamins and minerals. In some cases, medications may also be used to manage symptoms."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Seasonal Affective Disorder ?,"Some people experience a serious mood change during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. This condition is called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. SAD is a type of depression. It usually lifts during spring and summer.     Not everyone with SAD has the same symptoms. They include       - Sad, anxious or ""empty"" feelings    - Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism    - Feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness    - Irritability, restlessness    - Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy    - Fatigue and decreased energy    - Difficulty concentrating, remembering details and making decisions    - Difficulty sleeping or oversleeping    - Changes in weight    - Thoughts of death or suicide       SAD may be effectively treated with light therapy. But nearly half of people with SAD do not respond to light therapy alone. Antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can reduce SAD symptoms, either alone or combined with light therapy.    NIH: National Institute of Mental Health","Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs at a certain time each year. It usually begins and ends at about the same time each year. SAD begins and ends at about the same time each year.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia ?,"Dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia is a condition that affects blood cells and primarily occurs in males. A main feature of this condition is a type of anemia called dyserythropoietic anemia, which is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells. The term ""dyserythropoietic"" refers to the abnormal red blood cell formation that occurs in this condition. In affected individuals, immature red blood cells are unusually shaped and cannot develop into functional mature cells, leading to a shortage of healthy red blood cells. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have another blood disorder characterized by a reduced level of circulating platelets (thrombocytopenia). Platelets are cell fragments that normally assist with blood clotting. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. While people with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have signs and symptoms of both blood disorders, some are primarily affected by anemia, while others are more affected by thrombocytopenia.  The most severe cases of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia are characterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. For many others, the signs and symptoms of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia begin in infancy. People with this condition experience prolonged bleeding or bruising after minor trauma or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Anemia can cause pale skin, weakness, and fatigue. Severe anemia may create a need for frequent blood transfusions to replenish the supply of red blood cells; however, repeated blood transfusions over many years can cause health problems such as excess iron in the blood. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia may also have a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia), which can make them prone to recurrent infections. Additionally, they may have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). The severity of these abnormalities varies among affected individuals.  Some people with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia have additional blood disorders such as beta thalassemia or congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Beta thalassemia is a condition that reduces the production of hemoglobin, which is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A decrease in hemoglobin can lead to a shortage of oxygen in cells and tissues throughout the body. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is another disorder that impairs hemoglobin production. People with congenital erythropoietic porphyria are also very sensitive to sunlight, and areas of skin exposed to the sun can become fragile and blistered.","Dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia is a rare blood disorder characterized by anemia (low red blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The anemia is caused by a defect in the bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside bones that produces blood cells. The bone marrow is unable to produce enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. The thrombocytopenia is caused by a defect in the bone marrow that prevents it from producing enough platelets, which are cell fragments that help the blood to clot. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia may experience fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and easy bruising or bleeding. The condition is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, and it can be mild or severe. Treatment may include blood transfusions, medications, and bone marrow transplantation."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Family Issues ?,"There are many kinds of families. Some have two parents, while others have a single parent. Sometimes there is no parent and grandparents raise grandchildren. Some children live in foster families, adoptive families, or in stepfamilies.    Families are much more than groups of people who share the same genes or the same address. They should be a source of love and support. This does not mean that everyone gets along all the time. Conflicts are a part of family life. Many things can lead to conflict, such as illness, disability, addiction, job loss, school problems, and marital issues. Listening to each other and working to resolve conflicts are important in strengthening the family.","Family issues are problems that affect the family as a whole. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including financial difficulties, illness, or death of a family member, divorce, or other major life changes. Family issues can be difficult to deal with, but there are resources available to help families cope."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Satoyoshi syndrome ?,"Satoyoshi syndrome is a rare condition characterized by progressive, painful, intermittent muscle spasms, diarrhea or unusual malabsorption, amenorrhea, alopecia universalis, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities. Progressive painful intermittent muscle spasms usually start between 6 to 15 years of age. Alopecia universalis also appears around age 10. About half of affected individuals experience malabsorption, specifically of carbohydrates. The skeletal abnormalities may be secondary to muscle spasms. The main endocrine disorder is primary amenorrhea. All cases have apparently been sporadic, even when occurring in large families. The exact cause is unknown; but some researchers have speculated that Satoyoshi syndrome is an autoimmune disorder.","Satoyoshi syndrome is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. It is characterized by a combination of symptoms that include ataxia (uncoordinated movements), nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movements), and ataxia-telangiectasia-like oculocutaneous telangiectasia (small, dilated blood vessels in the skin). The condition is caused by mutations in the SETX gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called senataxin. This protein is involved in the repair of damaged DNA and in the regulation of gene activity. Mutations in the SETX gene lead to a loss of senataxin function, which disrupts the repair of damaged DNA and the regulation of gene activity. This can lead to the development of the symptoms of Satoyoshi syndrome."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) epidermolytic hyperkeratosis ?,"Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is a skin disorder that is present at birth. Affected babies may have very red skin (erythroderma) and severe blisters. Because newborns with this disorder are missing the protection provided by normal skin, they are at risk of becoming dehydrated and developing infections in the skin or throughout the body (sepsis).  As affected individuals get older, blistering is less frequent, erythroderma becomes less evident, and the skin becomes thick (hyperkeratotic), especially over joints, on areas of skin that come into contact with each other, or on the scalp or neck. This thickened skin is usually darker than normal. Bacteria can grow in the thick skin, often causing a distinct odor.  Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis can be categorized into two types. People with PS-type epidermolytic hyperkeratosis have thick skin on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet (palmoplantar or palm/sole hyperkeratosis) in addition to other areas of the body. People with the other type, NPS-type, do not have extensive palmoplantar hyperkeratosis but do have hyperkeratosis on other areas of the body.  Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is part of a group of conditions called ichthyoses, which refers to the scaly skin seen in individuals with related disorders. However, in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, the skin is thick but not scaly as in some of the other conditions in the group.","Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is a skin condition characterized by red, scaly skin that is often painful and itchy. The skin is also very sensitive to heat and friction. The condition is caused by mutations in the KRT1 or KRT10 gene."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Cardiac Arrest ?,"The heart has an internal electrical system that controls the rhythm of the heartbeat. Problems can cause abnormal heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. There are many types of arrhythmia. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or it can stop beating. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when the heart develops an arrhythmia that causes it to stop beating. This is different than a heart attack, where the heart usually continues to beat but blood flow to the heart is blocked.     There are many possible causes of SCA. They include coronary heart disease, physical stress, and some inherited disorders. Sometimes there is no known cause for the SCA.    Without medical attention, the person will die within a few minutes. People are less likely to die if they have early defibrillation. Defibrillation sends an electric shock to restore the heart rhythm to normal. You should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.    If you have had an SCA, an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chance of dying from a second SCA.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute","Cardiac arrest is a sudden, unexpected loss of heart function. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Cardiac arrest is different from a heart attack. A heart attack is caused by a blockage in the blood flow to the heart. Cardiac arrest is caused by an electrical problem in the heart. The heart stops beating and blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs. If cardiac arrest is not treated within minutes, death will occur."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) tyrosinemia ?,"Tyrosinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by disruptions in the multistep process that breaks down the amino acid tyrosine, a building block of most proteins. If untreated, tyrosine and its byproducts build up in tissues and organs, which can lead to serious health problems.  There are three types of tyrosinemia, which are each distinguished by their symptoms and genetic cause. Tyrosinemia type I, the most severe form of this disorder, is characterized by signs and symptoms that begin in the first few months of life. Affected infants fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) due to poor food tolerance because high-protein foods lead to diarrhea and vomiting. Affected infants may also have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), a cabbage-like odor, and an increased tendency to bleed (particularly nosebleeds). Tyrosinemia type I can lead to liver and kidney failure, softening and weakening of the bones (rickets), and an increased risk of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Some affected children have repeated neurologic crises that consist of changes in mental state, reduced sensation in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), abdominal pain, and respiratory failure. These crises can last from 1 to 7 days. Untreated, children with tyrosinemia type I often do not survive past the age of 10.  Tyrosinemia type II can affect the eyes, skin, and mental development. Signs and symptoms often begin in early childhood and include eye pain and redness, excessive tearing, abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia), and thick, painful skin on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis). About 50 percent of individuals with tyrosinemia type II have some degree of intellectual disability.  Tyrosinemia type III is the rarest of the three types. The characteristic features of this type include intellectual disability, seizures, and periodic loss of balance and coordination (intermittent ataxia).  About 10 percent of newborns have temporarily elevated levels of tyrosine (transient tyrosinemia). In these cases, the cause is not genetic. The most likely causes are vitamin C deficiency or immature liver enzymes due to premature birth.","Tyrosinemia is a group of inherited disorders that affect the liver and kidneys. Tyrosinemia is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme that breaks down the amino acid tyrosine. Tyrosine is an essential amino acid that is found in many foods, including meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Tyrosinemia can cause liver damage, kidney failure, and other health problems."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Macrodactyly of the hand ?,"Macrodactyly of the hand is a rare condition in which a person's fingers are abnormally large due to the overgrowth of the underlying bone and soft tissue. This condition is congenital, meaning that babies are born with it. Although babies are born with the condition, macrodactyly is usually not inherited. Most of the time, only one hand is affected, but usually more than one finger is involved. Macrodactyly may also coexist with syndactyly, a condition in which two fingers are fused together. Although it is a benign condition, macrodactyly is deforming and can look cosmetically displeasing. Surgery, usually involving multiple procedures, can help the problem.",Macrodactyly of the hand is a condition in which one or more fingers or toes are abnormally large. The condition is usually present at birth (congenital) and is usually limited to one hand or foot. The condition is usually caused by a genetic mutation.
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Alpers' Disease ?,"Alpers' disease is a progressive, neurodevelopmental, mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome characterized by three co-occurring clinical symptoms: psychomotor regression (dementia); seizures; and liver disease. It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutation in the gene for the mitochondrial DNA polymerase POLG. The disease occurs in about one in 100,000 persons. Most individuals with Alpers' disease do not show symptoms at birth and develop normally for weeks to years before the onset of symptoms. Diagnosis is established by testing for the POLG gene. Symptoms typically occur months before tissue samples show the mitochondrial DNA depletion, so that these depletion studies cannot be used for early diagnosis. About 80 percent of individuals with Alpers' disease develop symptoms in the first two years of life, and 20 percent develop symptoms between ages 2 and 25. The first symptoms of the disorder are usually nonspecific and may include hypoglycemia secondary to underlying liver disease, failure to thrive, infection-associated encephalopathy, spasticity, myoclonus (involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles), seizures, or liver failure. An increased protein level is seen in cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Cortical blindness (loss of vision due to damage to the area of the cortex that controls vision) develops in about 25 percent of cases. Gastrointestinal dysfunction and cardiomyopathy may occur. Dementia is typically episodic and often associated with an infection that occurs while another disease is in process. Seizures may be difficult to control and unrelenting seizures can cause developmental regression as well. ""Alpers-like"" disorders without liver disease are genetically different and have a different clinical course. Fewer than one-third of individuals with the ""Alpers-like"" phenotype without liver disease have POLG mutations.","Alpers' disease is a rare, progressive, and fatal disorder that affects the brain and liver. It is characterized by the accumulation of a toxic substance called ammonia in the brain. This accumulation causes brain damage and leads to a variety of symptoms, including seizures, developmental delay, and liver failure. Alpers' disease is caused by mutations in the POLG gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called polymerase gamma. This protein is involved in the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA, which is found in the mitochondria of cells. Mutations in the POLG gene can lead to the production of an abnormal polymerase gamma protein, which is unable to properly replicate and repair mitochondrial DNA. This can result in the accumulation of toxic substances in the brain and liver, leading to the symptoms of Alpers' disease. There is currently no cure for Alpers' disease, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) DICER1 syndrome ?,"DICER1 syndrome is an inherited disorder that increases the risk of a variety of cancerous and noncancerous (benign) tumors, most commonly certain types of tumors that occur in the lungs, kidneys, ovaries, and thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck). Affected individuals can develop one or more types of tumors, and members of the same family can have different types. However, the risk of tumor formation in individuals with DICER1 syndrome is only moderately increased compared with tumor risk in the general population; most individuals with genetic changes associated with this condition never develop tumors.  People with DICER1 syndrome who develop tumors most commonly develop pleuropulmonary blastoma, which is characterized by tumors that grow in lung tissue or in the outer covering of the lungs (the pleura). These tumors occur in infants and young children and are rare in adults. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is classified as one of three types on the basis of tumor characteristics: in type I, the growths are composed of air-filled pockets called cysts; in type II, the growths contain both cysts and solid tumors (or nodules); and in type III, the growth is a solid tumor that can fill a large portion of the chest. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is considered cancerous, and types II and III can spread (metastasize), often to the brain, liver, or bones. Individuals with pleuropulmonary blastoma may also develop an abnormal accumulation of air in the chest cavity that can lead to the collapse of a lung (pneumothorax).  Cystic nephroma, which involves multiple benign fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, can also occur; in people with DICER1 syndrome, the cysts develop early in childhood.  DICER1 syndrome is also associated with tumors in the ovaries known as Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, which typically develop in affected women in their teens or twenties. Some Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors release the male sex hormone testosterone; in these cases, affected women may develop facial hair, a deep voice, and other male characteristics. Some affected women have irregular menstrual cycles. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors usually do not metastasize.  People with DICER1 syndrome are also at risk of multinodular goiter, which is enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by the growth of multiple fluid-filled or solid tumors (both referred to as nodules). The nodules are generally slow-growing and benign. Despite the growths, the thyroid's function is often normal. Rarely, individuals with DICER1 syndrome develop thyroid cancer (thyroid carcinoma).","DICER1 syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is characterized by a variety of tumors, including tumors of the brain, lungs, kidneys, and ovaries. The tumors can occur at any age, but they are most common in childhood and adolescence. DICER1 syndrome is caused by mutations in the DICER1 gene. These mutations prevent the gene from producing a protein that is needed for the normal development and function of cells."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Neurogenic diabetes insipidus ?,"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is a disease that causes frequent urination. This type of diabetes insipidus results from damage to the pituitary gland, which disrupts the normal storage and release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When this hormone reaches the kidneys, it directs them to make less urine. Damage to the pituitary gland can be caused by different diseases as well as by head injuries, neurosurgery, or genetic disorders. To treat the ADH deficiency that results from any kind of damage to the pituitary, a synthetic hormone called desmopressin can be taken by an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill.","Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is a condition in which the body produces too much urine. This condition is caused by a problem with the pituitary gland, which is a small gland at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland produces a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which helps the kidneys control the amount of water in the body. When the pituitary gland does not produce enough ADH, the kidneys cannot reabsorb water from the urine, and the person produces large amounts of urine. This condition is also called central diabetes insipidus."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ?,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a disorder that results in the development of multiple abnormalities in the blood vessels.  In the circulatory system, blood carrying oxygen from the lungs is normally pumped by the heart into the arteries at high pressure. The pressure allows the blood to make its way through the arteries to the smaller vessels (arterioles and capillaries) that supply oxygen to the body's tissues. By the time blood reaches the capillaries, the pressure is much lower. The blood then proceeds from the capillaries into veins, through which it eventually returns to the heart.  In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, some arterial vessels flow directly into veins rather than into the capillaries. These abnormalities are called arteriovenous malformations. When they occur in vessels near the surface of the skin, where they are visible as red markings, they are known as telangiectases (the singular is telangiectasia).  Without the normal buffer of the capillaries, the blood moves from the arteries at high pressure into the thinner walled, less elastic veins. The extra pressure tends to strain and enlarge these blood vessels, and may result in compression or irritation of adjacent tissues and frequent episodes of severe bleeding (hemorrhage). Nosebleeds are very common in people with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and more serious problems may arise from hemorrhages in the brain, liver, lungs, or other organs.  Forms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia include type 1, type 2, type 3, and juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. People with type 1 tend to develop symptoms earlier than those with type 2, and are more likely to have blood vessel malformations in the lungs and brain. Type 2 and type 3 may be associated with a higher risk of liver involvement. Women are more likely than men to develop blood vessel malformations in the lungs with type 1, and are also at higher risk of liver involvement with both type 1 and type 2. Individuals with any form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, however, can have any of these problems.  Juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome is a condition that involves both arteriovenous malformations and a tendency to develop growths (polyps) in the gastrointestinal tract. Types 1, 2 and 3 do not appear to increase the likelihood of such polyps.","Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal blood vessels to form in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. The abnormal blood vessels are called telangiectasias. They are small, dilated blood vessels that can be seen through the skin as red or purple spots. Telangiectasias can also form in the mucous membranes, which are the moist tissues that line the body's cavities and openings. The most common symptoms of HHT are nosebleeds, bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, and anemia. HHT is caused by mutations in one of several genes. The most common gene involved is the ENG gene, which is responsible for the production of a protein called endoglin. Endoglin is involved in the formation of blood vessels. Mutations in the ENG gene can cause HHT by disrupting the normal development of blood vessels. There is no cure for HHT, but treatment can help to control symptoms. Treatment may include medications to stop bleeding, surgery to remove abnormal blood vessels, and blood transfusions to treat anemia."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Lamellar ichthyosis ?,"Lamellar ichthyosis is a rare genetic condition that affects the skin. Infants affected by lamellar ichthyosis are generally born with a shiny, waxy layer of skin (called a collodian membrane) that is typically shed within the first two weeks of life. The skin beneath the collodian membrane is red and scaly. Other signs and symptoms of the condition may include ectropion, lips that turn outwards, hair loss, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis (thick skin on the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet), nail abnormalities, dehydration and respiratory problems. Although the condition may be caused by changes (mutations) in one of several different genes, approximately 90% of cases are caused by mutations in the TGM1 gene. Lamellar ichthyosis is generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.","Lamellar ichthyosis is a rare skin condition that causes the skin to become very dry and scaly. The skin is also thick and has a fish-like appearance. The condition is caused by a mutation in the TGM1 gene, which is responsible for producing a protein called transglutaminase 1. This protein is important for the normal development and function of the skin. There is no cure for lamellar ichthyosis, but treatment can help to improve the symptoms."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Periventricular Leukomalacia ?,"Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is characterized by the death of the white matter of the brain due to softening of the brain tissue. It can affect fetuses or newborns; premature babies are at the greatest risk of the disorder. PVL is caused by a lack of oxygen or blood flow to the periventricular area of the brain, which results in the death or loss of brain tissue. The periventricular area-the area around the spaces in the brain called ventricles-contains nerve fibers that carry messages from the brain to the body's muscles. Although babies with PVL generally have no outward signs or symptoms of the disorder, they are at risk for motor disorders, delayed mental development, coordination problems, and vision and hearing impairments. PVL may be accompanied by a hemorrhage or bleeding in the periventricular-intraventricular area (the area around and inside the ventricles), and can lead to cerebral palsy. The disorder is diagnosed by ultrasound of the head.","Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a brain injury that occurs in premature infants. It is caused by damage to the white matter of the brain, which is the tissue that connects different parts of the brain. PVL can lead to a variety of problems, including cerebral palsy, developmental delay, and intellectual disability."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Dentinogenesis imperfecta ?,"Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a condition that results in issues with tooth development, causing the teeth to be translucent and discolored (most often a blue-gray or yellow-brown in color). Individuals with this disorder tend to have teeth that are weaker than normal which leads to increased wear, breakage, and loss of the teeth. This can affect both primary (baby) and permanent teeth. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the DSPP gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There are three types of dentinogenesis imperfecta. Type I: occurs in people who have osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition in which bones are brittle, causing them to break easily. Type II and type III: usually occur in people without another inherited disorder. Some families with type II also have progressive hearing loss. Type III was first identified in a population in Brandywine, Maryland. Some researchers believe that dentinogenesis imperfecta type II and type III, along with a similar condition called dentin dysplasia type II, are actually just different forms of a single disorder.","Dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) is a group of inherited disorders that affect the teeth. The teeth are usually discolored, and the enamel is thin and easily chipped. The teeth are also more likely to decay. DI is caused by mutations in the DSPP gene."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Kidney Diseases ?,"Your kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fists. They are located near the middle of your back, just below the rib cage. Inside each kidney about a million tiny structures called nephrons filter blood. They remove waste products and extra water, which become urine. The urine flows through tubes called ureters to your bladder, which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom.     Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems, injuries, or medicines. You are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or a close family member with kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years. Other kidney problems include:       - Cancer    - Cysts    - Stones    - Infections       Your doctor can run tests to find out if you have kidney disease. If your kidneys fail completely, a kidney transplant or dialysis can replace the work your kidneys normally do.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases","Kidney diseases are disorders that affect the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. The kidneys filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood, which are then excreted in the urine. The kidneys also produce hormones that help control blood pressure and make red blood cells. Kidney diseases can affect one or both kidneys. They can be acute or chronic. Acute kidney disease comes on suddenly and can be life-threatening. Chronic kidney disease develops slowly and worsens over time. It can lead to kidney failure, which is a life-threatening condition. Kidney diseases can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and infections. They can also be inherited. Symptoms of kidney disease can include swelling, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of the disease. It may include medications, dialysis, or a kidney transplant."
