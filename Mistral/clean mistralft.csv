Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ?,"Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.  Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency often becomes evident in the first few days of life. An infant with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have poorly-controlled breathing rate or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder may experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications from ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may include developmental delay and intellectual disability. Progressive liver damage, skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen.  In some affected individuals, signs and symptoms of ornithine transcarbamylase may be less severe, and may not appear until later in life.","Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is a rare inherited disorder that affects the metabolism of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins). This disorder is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), which is necessary for the normal processing of amino acids. A deficiency of OTC can lead to a buildup of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia), which can cause serious neurological problems and, if untreated, can be life-threatening. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The disorder is more common in people of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and Asian descent. Treatment for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency includes dietary changes, medications, and supplements to help control the buildup of ammonia in the blood."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) globozoospermia ?,"Globozoospermia is a condition that affects only males. It is characterized by abnormal sperm and leads to an inability to father biological children (infertility).  Normal sperm cells have an oval-shaped head with a cap-like covering called the acrosome. The acrosome contains enzymes that break down the outer membrane of an egg cell, allowing the sperm to fertilize the egg. The sperm cells of males with globozoospermia, however, have a round head and no acrosome. The abnormal sperm are unable to fertilize an egg cell, leading to infertility.","Globozoospermia is a rare condition in which the sperm have an abnormal shape. Normally, sperm have an oval shape with a head, midpiece, and tail. In globozoospermia, the sperm have a round head with no midpiece or tail. This condition is usually caused by a genetic mutation. It can be inherited or it can occur spontaneously. Globozoospermia is associated with infertility."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) hypochondrogenesis ?,"Hypochondrogenesis is a rare, severe disorder of bone growth. This condition is characterized by a small body, short limbs, and abnormal bone formation (ossification) in the spine and pelvis.  Affected infants have short arms and legs, a small chest with short ribs, and underdeveloped lungs. Bones in the skull develop normally, but the bones of the spine (vertebrae) and pelvis do not harden (ossify) properly. The face appears flat and oval-shaped, with widely spaced eyes, a small chin, and, in some cases, an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate. Individuals with hypochondrogenesis have an enlarged abdomen and may have a condition called hydrops fetalis in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth.  As a result of these serious health problems, some affected fetuses do not survive to term. Infants born with hypochondrogenesis usually die at birth or shortly thereafter from respiratory failure. Babies who live past the newborn period are usually reclassified as having spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a related but milder disorder that similarly affects bone development.","Hypochondrogenesis is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of cartilage and bone. It is characterized by short stature, shortened limbs, and abnormalities of the spine, ribs, and pelvis. The condition is caused by mutations in the COL2A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and may include physical therapy, bracing, and surgery to correct skeletal abnormalities."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Macular Degeneration ?,"Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving.     AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.    Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.    NIH: National Eye Institute","Macular degeneration is a disease that damages the macula, a small spot near the center of the retina and the part of the eye needed for sharp, central vision, which lets us see objects that are straight ahead. When the macula does not send clear information to the brain, central vision can become blurry.
                
Macular degeneration affects the ability to see fine details, such as the ability to read or drive. It does not cause complete blindness, but it can make everyday activities difficult.
                
There are two types of macular degeneration: dry and wet. Dry macular degeneration is more common and usually progresses more slowly. Wet macular degeneration is less common but more severe.
                
Macular degeneration is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 years of age and older.
                
Macular degeneration is not contagious. It is not a result of aging, but it becomes more common as people get older.
                
Macular degeneration is not a cureable disease. However, treatments can slow its progression.
                
Macular degeneration is not a reversible disease. However, treatments can slow its progression."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ?,"Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a disorder in which the immune system produces too many activated immune cells (lymphocytes) called T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and macrophages (histiocytes). Excessive amounts of immune system proteins called cytokines are also produced. This overactivation of the immune system causes fever and damages the liver and spleen, resulting in enlargement of these organs.  Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis also destroys blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, a process called hemophagocytosis. As a result, affected individuals have low numbers of red blood cells (anemia) and a reduction in the number of blood cells involved in clotting (platelets). A reduction in platelets may cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.  The brain may also be affected in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. As a result, affected individuals may experience irritability, delayed closure of the bones of the skull in infants, neck stiffness, abnormal muscle tone, impaired muscle coordination, paralysis, blindness, seizures, and coma. In addition to neurological problems, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can cause abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemia and lymphoma).  Signs and symptoms of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis usually become apparent during infancy, although occasionally they appear later in life. They usually occur when the immune system launches an exaggerated response to an infection, but may also occur in the absence of infection. Without treatment, most people with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis survive only a few months.","Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a rare, inherited disorder that causes the immune system to become overactive. This overactivity leads to the destruction of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, which can cause anemia, low white blood cell count (neutropenia), and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). FHL is caused by mutations in the UNC13D, PRF1, or STX11 genes. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is focused on reducing the overactivity of the immune system."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ?,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a genetic disorder that occurs primarily in males. It mainly affects the nervous system and the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney. In this disorder, the fatty covering (myelin) that insulates nerves in the brain and spinal cord is prone to deterioration (demyelination), which reduces the ability of the nerves to relay information to the brain. In addition, damage to the outer layer of the adrenal glands (adrenal cortex) causes a shortage of certain hormones (adrenocortical insufficiency). Adrenocortical insufficiency may cause weakness, weight loss, skin changes, vomiting, and coma.  There are three distinct types of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy: a childhood cerebral form, an adrenomyeloneuropathy type, and a form called Addison disease only.  Children with the cerebral form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy experience learning and behavioral problems that usually begin between the ages of 4 and 10. Over time the symptoms worsen, and these children may have difficulty reading, writing, understanding speech, and comprehending written material. Additional signs and symptoms of the cerebral form include aggressive behavior, vision problems, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, and impaired adrenal gland function. The rate at which this disorder progresses is variable but can be extremely rapid, often leading to total disability within a few years. The life expectancy of individuals with this type depends on the severity of the signs and symptoms and how quickly the disorder progresses. Individuals with the cerebral form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy usually survive only a few years after symptoms begin but may survive longer with intensive medical support.  Signs and symptoms of the adrenomyeloneuropathy type appear between early adulthood and middle age. Affected individuals develop progressive stiffness and weakness in their legs (paraparesis), experience urinary and genital tract disorders, and often show changes in behavior and thinking ability. Most people with the adrenomyeloneuropathy type also have adrenocortical insufficiency. In some severely affected individuals, damage to the brain and nervous system can lead to early death.  People with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy whose only symptom is adrenocortical insufficiency are said to have the Addison disease only form. In these individuals, adrenocortical insufficiency can begin anytime between childhood and adulthood. However, most affected individuals develop the additional features of the adrenomyeloneuropathy type by the time they reach middle age. The life expectancy of individuals with this form depends on the severity of the signs and symptoms, but typically this is the mildest of the three types.  Rarely, individuals with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy develop multiple features of the disorder in adolescence or early adulthood. In addition to adrenocortical insufficiency, these individuals usually have psychiatric disorders and a loss of intellectual function (dementia). It is unclear whether these individuals have a distinct form of the condition or a variation of one of the previously described types.  For reasons that are unclear, different forms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy can be seen in affected individuals within the same family.","X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the nervous system and adrenal glands. The disorder is caused by a mutation in the ABCD1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called ALDP. This protein is found in the membrane of cells that produce myelin, a fatty substance that forms a protective covering around nerve cells. The ALDP protein is also found in the membrane of cells that produce adrenal hormones.  In X-ALD, the mutation in the ABCD1 gene prevents the ALDP protein from functioning properly. As a result, myelin is not produced or maintained properly, and the fatty acids that are normally transported by the ALDP protein build up in the body. The buildup of fatty acids damages the myelin sheaths surrounding nerve cells, leading to the signs and symptoms of X-ALD.  X-ALD is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The disorder affects males almost exclusively, because they have only one X chromosome. Females who inherit a mutated copy of the ABCD1 gene from one parent are carriers of"
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia ?,"Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is a neurological condition characterized by changes to certain areas of the brain. A hallmark of ALSP is leukoencephalopathy, which is the alteration of a type of brain tissue called white matter. White matter consists of nerve fibers (axons) covered by a substance called myelin that insulates and protects them. The axons extend from nerve cells (neurons) and transmit nerve impulses throughout the body. Areas of damage to this brain tissue (white matter lesions) can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Another feature of ALSP is swellings called spheroids in the axons of the brain, which are a sign of axon damage. Also common in ALSP are abnormally pigmented glial cells. Glial cells are specialized brain cells that protect and maintain neurons. Damage to myelin and neurons is thought to contribute to many of the neurological signs and symptoms in people with ALSP.  Symptoms of ALSP usually begin in a person's forties and worsen over time. Personality changes, including depression and a loss of social inhibitions, are among the earliest symptoms of ALSP. Affected individuals may develop memory loss and loss of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies. Loss of this function impairs skills such as impulse control, self-monitoring, and focusing attention appropriately. Some people with ALSP have mild seizures, usually only when the condition begins. As ALSP progresses, it causes a severe decline in thinking and reasoning abilities (dementia).  Over time, motor skills are affected, and people with ALSP may have difficulty walking. Many develop a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, which includes unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), involuntary trembling (tremor), and muscle stiffness (rigidity). The pattern of cognitive and motor problems are variable, even among individuals in the same family, although almost all affected individuals ultimately become unable to walk, speak, and care for themselves.  ALSP was previously thought to be two separate conditions, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD), both of which cause very similar white matter damage and cognitive and movement problems. POLD was thought to be distinguished by the presence of pigmented glial cells and an absence of spheroids; however, people with HDLS can have pigmented cells, too, and people with POLD can have spheroids. HDLS and POLD are now considered to be part of the same disease spectrum, which researchers have recommended calling ALSP.","Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSPG) is a rare, inherited, neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. The disease is characterized by the presence of spheroid bodies (clumps of protein) in the axons (nerve fibers) of the brain and spinal cord, and the accumulation of pigmented glial cells (cells that support and protect nerve cells). The disease typically begins in adulthood, with symptoms such as progressive weakness, stiffness, and spasticity in the legs, difficulty walking, and problems with balance and coordination. Other symptoms may include cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and seizures. The disease is caused by mutations in the SPG11 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There is no cure for ALSPG, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) hypomyelination and congenital cataract ?,"Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is an inherited condition that affects the nervous system and the eyes. This disease is one of a group of genetic disorders called leukoencephalopathies. Leukoencephalopathies involve abnormalities of the brain's white matter. White matter consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is caused by a reduced ability to form myelin (hypomyelination). Additionally, people with this disorder are typically born with a clouding of the lens (cataract) in both eyes.  People with this condition usually have normal development throughout the first year of life. Development slows around the age of 1. Most affected children learn to walk between the ages of 1 and 2, although they usually need some type of support. Over time they experience muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) in their legs, and many affected people eventually require wheelchair assistance. Weakness in the muscles of the trunk and a progressive abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) further impair walking in some individuals. Most people with hypomyelination and congenital cataract have reduced sensation in their arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy). In addition, affected individuals typically have speech difficulties (dysarthria) and mild to moderate intellectual disability.","Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the myelin sheath (hypomyelination) in the brain and spinal cord, and the presence of cataracts at birth. The myelin sheath is a fatty substance that surrounds nerve cells and helps them transmit signals. The absence or underdevelopment of the myelin sheath can cause a variety of neurological problems, including muscle weakness, difficulty walking, and intellectual disability. Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens of the eye that prevent light from passing through and can cause vision problems. The severity of the symptoms associated with hypomyelination and congenital cataract can vary widely among affected individuals. Some people may have only mild neurological problems, while others may have severe intellectual disability and require lifelong care. Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is caused by mutations in the ELOVL4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms of the condition."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Craniopharyngioma ?,"A craniopharyngioma is a slow-growing benign tumor that develops near the pituitary gland (a small endocrine gland at the base of the brain) and the hypothalamus (a small cone-shaped organ connected to the pituitary gland by nerves). This tumor most commonly affects children between 5 and 10 years of age; however, adults can sometimes be affected. Craniopharyngiomas are thought to arise from remnants of the craniopharyngeal duct and/or Rathke cleft or from metaplasia (abnormal transformation of cells) of squamous epithelial cell remnants of the stomadeum.[orphanet] Craniopharyngioma is treated with surgery alone or by surgery followed by radiation.","Craniopharyngioma is a rare, slow-growing brain tumor that usually occurs in the region of the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus. It is a benign tumor, but it can cause serious problems by pressing on nearby structures in the brain. Craniopharyngiomas are most common in children and young adults. They are more common in males than in females."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Tropical Spastic Paraparesis ?,"For several decades the term tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) has been used to describe a chronic and progressive disease of the nervous system that affects adults living in equatorial areas of the world and causes progressive weakness, stiff muscles, muscle spasms, sensory disturbance, and sphincter dysfunction. The cause of TSP was obscure until the mid-1980s, when an important association was established between the human retrovirus  human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 (also known as HTLV-1)  and TSP. TSP is now called HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis or HAM/TSP. The HTLV-1 retrovirus is thought to cause at least 80 percent of the cases of HAM/TSP by impairing the immune system. In addition to neurological symptoms of weakness and muscle stiffness or spasms, in rare cases individuals with HAM/TSP also exhibit uveitis (inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye), arthritis (inflammation of one or more joints), pulmonary lymphocytic alveolitis (inflammation of the lung), polymyositis (an inflammatory muscle disease), keratoconjunctivitis sicca (persistent dryness of the cornea and conjunctiva), and infectious dermatitis (inflammation of the skin). The other serious complication of HTLV-1 infection is the development of adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma. Nervous system and blood-related complications occur only in a very small proportion of infected individuals, while most remain largely without symptoms throughout their lives.
                
The HTLV-1 virus is transmitted person-to-person via infected cells: breast-feeding by mothers who are seropositive (in other words, have high levels of virus antibodies in their blood), sharing infected needles during intravenous drug use, or having sexual relations with a seropositive partner. Less than 2 percent of HTLV-1 seropositive carriers will become HAM/TSP patients.","Tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) is a neurological disorder that affects the lower limbs. It is caused by a viral infection of the central nervous system. The virus that causes TSP is called the JC virus. TSP is also known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). TSP is most common in tropical and subtropical regions. It is rare in the United States. TSP is more common in men than in women. TSP is a slowly progressive disorder. It usually begins with weakness in the legs. The weakness may be accompanied by stiffness, spasticity, and difficulty walking. The weakness and stiffness may spread to the arms and upper body. Other symptoms of TSP may include numbness, tingling, and pain in the legs. TSP is a chronic disorder. There is no cure for TSP. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and improving quality of life."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Encephalitis lethargica ?,"Encephalitis lethargica is a disease characterized by high fever, headache, double vision, delayed physical and mental response, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and sometimes coma. Patients may also experience abnormal eye movements, upper body weakness, muscule pain, tremors, neck rigidity, and behavioral changes including psychosis. A world-wide epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred from 1917 to 1928. The cause of this condition is unknown, and treatment depends on a person's symptoms. Levodopa and other antiparkinson drugs often produce dramatic responses.","Encephalitis lethargica is a rare, inflammatory disease of the brain that was first described in 1917. It is also known as von Economo's encephalitis. The disease is characterized by a sudden onset of flu-like symptoms, followed by a period of lethargy and sleepiness. Other symptoms may include muscle stiffness, tremors, and involuntary movements. The cause of the disease is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a viral infection. There is no specific treatment for encephalitis lethargica, and the prognosis is generally poor. The disease is very rare today, with only a few cases reported each year."

Signs and symptoms of CMT1E generally become apparent between age 5 and 25 years, although the age of onset and disease severity can vary significantly from person to person. In general, CMT1E is associated with the typical features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (progressive weakness of the feet and/or ankles; foot drop; atrophy of muscles below the knee; absent tendon reflexes of upper and lower extremities; and a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and/or lower legs) in addition to hearing loss. CMT1E is caused by certain changes (mutations) in the PMP22 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Shock ?,"Shock happens when not enough blood and oxygen can get to your organs and tissues. It causes very low blood pressure and may be life threatening. It often happens along with a serious injury.     There are several kinds of shock. Hypovolemic shock happens when you lose a lot of blood or fluids. Causes include internal or external bleeding, dehydration, burns, and severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. Septic shock is caused by infections in the bloodstream. A severe allergic reaction can cause anaphylactic shock. An insect bite or sting might cause it. Cardiogenic shock happens when the heart cannot pump blood effectively. This may happen after a heart attack. Neurogenic shock is caused by damage to the nervous system.    Symptoms of shock include       - Confusion or lack of alertness    - Loss of consciousness    - Sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat    - Sweating    - Pale skin    - A weak pulse    - Rapid breathing    - Decreased or no urine output    - Cool hands and feet       Shock is a life-threatening medical emergency and it is important to get help right away.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) microvillus inclusion disease ?,"Microvillus inclusion disease is a condition characterized by chronic, watery, life-threatening diarrhea typically beginning in the first hours to days of life. Rarely, the diarrhea starts around age 3 or 4 months. Food intake increases the frequency of diarrhea.  Microvillus inclusion disease prevents the absorption of nutrients from food during digestion, resulting in malnutrition and dehydration. Affected infants often have difficulty gaining weight and growing at the expected rate (failure to thrive), developmental delay, liver and kidney problems, and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). Some affected individuals develop cholestasis, which is a reduced ability to produce and release a digestive fluid called bile. Cholestasis leads to irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis).  In individuals with microvillus inclusion disease, lifelong nutritional support is needed and given through intravenous feedings (parenteral nutrition). Even with nutritional supplementation, most children with microvillus inclusion disease do not survive beyond childhood.  A variant of microvillus inclusion disease with milder diarrhea often does not require full-time parenteral nutrition. Individuals with the variant type frequently live past childhood.","Microvillus inclusion disease is a rare inherited disorder that affects the intestines. People with this condition are unable to absorb nutrients from food, which can lead to severe malnutrition and dehydration. Microvillus inclusion disease is caused by mutations in the MYO5B gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is diagnosed in infancy and is usually fatal within the first year of life. Treatment is supportive and includes intravenous feeding and medications to treat diarrhea."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ?,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a cancer of the kidney.  The name ""clear cell"" refers to the appearance of the cancer cells when viewed with a microscope.[5258]  Clear cell renal cell carcinoma occurs when cells in the kidney quickly increase in number, creating a lump (mass).  Though the exact cause of clear cell renal cell carcinoma is unknown, smoking, the excessive use of certain medications, and several genetic predisposition conditions (such as von Hippel Lindau syndrome) may contribute to the development of this type of cancer.  Treatment often begins with surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible, and may be followed by radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, or targeted therapy.","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a type of kidney cancer that is characterized by the presence of clear cells in the tumor. Clear cells are cells that have a clear appearance when viewed under a microscope. ccRCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. It is usually found in people over the age of 50. The exact cause of ccRCC is not known, but it is thought to be related to changes in the genes that control cell growth.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) genitopatellar syndrome ?,"Genitopatellar syndrome is a rare condition characterized by genital abnormalities, missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body.  The genital abnormalities in affected males typically include undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and underdevelopment of the scrotum. Affected females can have an enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly) and small labia.  Missing or underdeveloped patellae is the most common skeletal abnormality associated with genitopatellar syndrome. Affected individuals may have additional skeletal problems, including joint deformities (contractures) involving the hips and knees or an inward- and upward-turning foot called a clubfoot. Bone abnormalities of the spine, ribs, collarbone (clavicle), and pelvis have also been reported.  Genitopatellar syndrome is also associated with delayed development and intellectual disability, which are often severe. Affected individuals may have an usually small head (microcephaly) and structural brain abnormalities, including underdeveloped or absent tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum).  People with genitopatellar syndrome may have distinctive facial features such as prominent cheeks and eyes, a nose with a rounded tip or a broad bridge, an unusually small chin (micrognathia) or a chin that protrudes (prognathism), and a narrowing of the head at the temples. Many affected infants have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that leads to breathing and feeding difficulties.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Juvenile Arthritis ?,"Juvenile arthritis (JA) is arthritis that happens in children. It causes joint swelling, pain, stiffness, and loss of motion. It can affect any joint, but is more common in the knees, hands, and feet. In some cases it can affect internal organs as well.    The most common type of JA that children get is juvenile idiopathic arthritis. There are several other forms of arthritis affecting children.    One early sign of JA may be limping in the morning. Symptoms can come and go. Some children have just one or two flare-ups. Others have symptoms that never go away. JA can cause growth problems and eye inflammation in some children.    No one knows exactly what causes JA. Most types are autoimmune disorders. This means that your immune system, which normally helps your body fight infection, attacks your body's own tissues.    JA can be hard to diagnose. Your health care provider may do a physical exam, lab tests, and x-rays. A team of providers usually treats JA. Medicines and physical therapy can help maintain movement and reduce swelling and pain. They may also help prevent and treat complications.

It is characterized by a large, port-wine birthmark, abnormal growth of the limbs, and varicose veins. The birthmark is usually present at birth and is located on the lower limbs. The abnormal growth of the limbs can cause the affected limb to be longer or shorter than the other limbs, or it can cause the limb to be wider or narrower than the other limbs. The varicose veins can cause pain, swelling, and skin ulcers. The cause of KTS is unknown. It is not inherited and occurs in about 1 in 100,000 people. Treatment is usually focused on managing the symptoms."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) familial pityriasis rubra pilaris ?,"Familial pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare genetic condition that affects the skin. The name of the condition reflects its major features: The term ""pityriasis"" refers to scaling; ""rubra"" means redness; and ""pilaris"" suggests the involvement of hair follicles in this disorder. Affected individuals have a salmon-colored skin rash covered in fine scales. This rash occurs in patches all over the body, with distinct areas of unaffected skin between the patches. Affected individuals also develop bumps called follicular keratoses that occur around hair follicles. The skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet often becomes thick, hard, and callused, a condition known as palmoplantar keratoderma.  Researchers have distinguished six types of pityriasis rubra pilaris based on the features of the disorder and the age at which signs and symptoms appear. The familial form is usually considered part of type V, which is also known as the atypical juvenile type. People with familial pityriasis rubra pilaris typically have skin abnormalities from birth or early childhood, and these skin problems persist throughout life.","Familial pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare inherited skin disorder characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?,"Key Points
                    - Intraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.    - Being older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma.    - Signs of intraocular melanoma include blurred vision or a dark spot on the iris.     - Tests that examine the eye are used to help detect (find) and diagnose intraocular melanoma.    - A biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Intraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.
                    Intraocular melanoma begins in the middle of three layers of the wall of the eye. The outer layer includes the white sclera (the ""white of the eye"") and the clear cornea at the front of the eye. The inner layer has a lining of nerve tissue, called the retina, which senses light and sends images along the optic nerve to the brain.   The middle layer, where intraocular melanoma forms, is called the uvea or uveal tract, and has three main parts:         -  Iris  The iris is the colored area at the front of the eye (the ""eye color""). It can be seen through the clear cornea. The pupil is in the center of the iris and it changes size to let more or less light into the eye. Intraocular melanoma of the iris is usually a small tumor that grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body.    -  Ciliary body  The ciliary body is a ring of tissue with muscle fibers that change the size of the pupil and the shape of the lens. It is found behind the iris. Changes in the shape of the lens help the eye focus. The ciliary body also makes the clear fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the iris. Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.      -  Choroid  The choroid is a layer of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the eye. Most intraocular melanomas begin in the choroid. Intraocular melanoma of the choroid is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.          Intraocular melanoma is a rare cancer that forms from cells that make melanin in the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. It is the most common eye cancer in adults.","Intraocular melanoma is a cancer that starts in the pigmented cells of the eye. It is the most common primary cancer of the eye. The cancer usually starts in the choroid, which is the layer of blood vessels that nourishes the retina. The cancer can also start in the ciliary body or iris. Intraocular melanoma is a rare cancer. It is more common in whites than in blacks. It is more common in men than in women. The average age of diagnosis is 55 years. The cause of intraocular melanoma is not known. It is not caused by exposure to sunlight."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disorder that can cause a variety of neurological problems. People with this condition typically have developmental delay, especially involving speech development; intellectual disability; and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) soon after birth. About half of those affected experience seizures, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), decreased reflexes (hyporeflexia), and behavioral problems. The most common behavioral problems associated with this condition are sleep disturbances, hyperactivity, difficulty maintaining attention, and anxiety. Less frequently, affected individuals may have increased aggression, hallucinations, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and self-injurious behavior, including biting and head banging. People with this condition can also have problems controlling eye movements. Less common features of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency include uncontrollable movements of the limbs (choreoathetosis), involuntary tensing of the muscles (dystonia), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and a progressive worsening of ataxia.","Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down certain substances in food.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Beriberi ?,"Beriberi is a condition that occurs in people who are deficient in thiamine (vitamin B1). There are two major types of beriberi: wet beriberi which affects the cardiovascular system and dry beriberi which affects the nervous system. People with wet beriberi may experience increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and swelling of the lower legs. Signs and symptoms of dry beriberi include difficulty walking; loss of feeling in the hands and/or feet; paralysis of the lower legs; mental confusion; speech difficulty; pain; and/or vomiting. Beriberi is rare in the United States since many foods are now vitamin enriched; however, alcohol abuse, dialysis and taking high doses of diuretics increases the risk of developing the condition. In most cases, beriberi occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. A rare condition known as genetic beriberi is inherited (passed down through families) and is associated with an inability to absorb thiamine from foods. Treatment generally includes thiamine supplementation, given by injection or taken by mouth.","Beriberi is a disease caused by a thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. It can affect the heart, nerves, and muscles. The most common form of beriberi is wet beriberi, which affects the heart. It can cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, and swelling in the legs and feet. Dry beriberi affects the nerves and can cause numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness. It can also cause paralysis. Beriberi is most common in people who eat a diet that is low in thiamine, such as people who eat a lot of rice and not enough other foods. It can also occur in people who have a disorder that prevents their body from absorbing thiamine. Beriberi is rare in the United States, but it is common in some parts of Asia and Africa. It can be treated with thiamine supplements."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina ?,"Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina, which is often shortened to gyrate atrophy, is an inherited disorder characterized by progressive vision loss. People with this disorder have an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye, and in a nearby tissue layer called the choroid. During childhood, they begin experiencing nearsightedness (myopia), difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness), and loss of side (peripheral) vision. Over time, their field of vision continues to narrow, resulting in tunnel vision. Many people with gyrate atrophy also develop clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts). These progressive vision changes lead to blindness by about the age of 50.  Most people with gyrate atrophy have no symptoms other than vision loss, but some have additional features of the disorder. Occasionally, newborns with gyrate atrophy develop excess ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia), which may lead to poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, or coma. Neonatal hyperammonemia associated with gyrate atrophy generally responds quickly to treatment and does not recur after the newborn period.  Gyrate atrophy usually does not affect intelligence; however, abnormalities may be observed in brain imaging or other neurological testing. In some cases, mild to moderate intellectual disability is associated with gyrate atrophy.  Gyrate atrophy may also cause disturbances in the nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells (peripheral nervous system). In some people with the disorder these abnormalities lead to numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, while in others they are detectable only by electrical testing of the nerve impulses.  In some people with gyrate atrophy, a particular type of muscle fibers (type II fibers) break down over time. While this muscle abnormality usually causes no symptoms, it may result in mild weakness.","Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (GA) is a rare inherited disorder that causes progressive vision loss. It is caused by a mutation in the OAT gene. The OAT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called ornithine aminotransferase (OAT). This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of a substance called ornithine. In people with GA, the OAT enzyme is not functional, which leads to a buildup of ornithine and other substances in the body. This buildup can cause damage to the eyes, brain, and other organs. GA is characterized by progressive vision loss, which usually begins in childhood. Other signs and symptoms of GA may include nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), strabismus (crossed eyes), and optic atrophy (damage to the optic nerve). GA can also cause intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological problems. There is no cure for GA, but treatment can help manage the symptoms. Treatment may include dietary changes, medications, and surgery."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Shoulder Injuries and Disorders ?,"Your shoulder joint is composed of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone). Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They can also be unstable because the ball of the upper arm is larger than the shoulder socket that holds it. To remain in a stable or normal position, the shoulder must be anchored by muscles, tendons and ligaments. Because the shoulder can be unstable, it is the site of many common problems. They include sprains, strains, dislocations, separations, tendinitis, bursitis, torn rotator cuffs, frozen shoulder, fractures and arthritis.     Usually shoulder problems are treated with RICE. This stands for Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. Other treatments include exercise, medicines to reduce pain and swelling, and surgery if other treatments don't work.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases","Shoulder injuries and disorders are painful conditions that interfere with your ability to move your arm. They are very common. Many problems in the shoulder are related to aging. Common problems include rotator cuff disorders, fractures, dislocations, tendinitis and bursitis.
                
The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint made up of three bones: the shoulder blade (scapula), the arm bone (humerus), and the collarbone (clavicle). The head of the humerus is the ball, and the socket is formed by the scapula. Your shoulder joint is surrounded by muscles, ligaments, and a protective covering of fluid.
                
The rotator cuff is a group of tendons and muscles that surround the shoulder joint, providing strength and stability. A rotator cuff disorder can cause pain, weakness, and limited motion.
                
The shoulder joint also has a bursa, a small fluid-filled sac that cushions the shoulder joint. Bursitis is painful swelling of the bursa.
                
Treatment for shoulder problems depends on the cause. It may include rest, physical therapy, activity changes, injections, and surgery."

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Glycogen storage disease type 7 ?,"Glycogen storage disease type 7 (GSD7) is an inherited condition in which the body is unable to break down glycogen (a complex sugar) in the muscle cells. Because glycogen is an important source of energy, this can interfere with the normal functioning of muscle cells. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary, but may include muscle weakness and stiffness; painful muscle cramps; nausea and vomiting; and/or myoglobinuria (the presence of myoglobin in the urine) following moderate to strenuous exercise. Symptoms typically resolve with rest. GSD7 is most commonly diagnosed during childhood; however, some affected people may rarely develop symptoms during infancy or later in adulthood. Those who develop the condition during infancy may experience additional symptoms such as hypotonia (poor muscle tone), cardiomyopathy and breathing difficulties that often lead to a shortened lifespan (less than 1 year). This condition is caused by changes (mutations) in the PFKM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is no specific treatment for GSD7; however, affected people are generally advised to avoid vigorous exercise and high-carbohydrate meals.","Glycogen storage disease type 7 (GSD7) is a rare inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to break down glycogen, a complex sugar that serves as a source of energy. Glycogen is stored in the liver and muscles.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Baraitser-Winter syndrome ?,"Baraitser-Winter syndrome is a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body, particularly the face and the brain.  An unusual facial appearance is the most common characteristic of Baraitser-Winter syndrome. Distinctive facial features can include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large eyelid openings, droopy eyelids (ptosis), high-arched eyebrows, a broad nasal bridge and tip of the nose, a long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), full cheeks, and a pointed chin.  Structural brain abnormalities are also present in most people with Baraitser-Winter syndrome. These abnormalities are related to impaired neuronal migration, a process by which nerve cells (neurons) move to their proper positions in the developing brain. The most frequent brain abnormality associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome is pachygyria, which is an area of the brain that has an abnormally smooth surface with fewer folds and grooves. Less commonly, affected individuals have lissencephaly, which is similar to pachygyria but involves the entire brain surface. These structural changes can cause mild to severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures.  Other features of Baraitser-Winter syndrome can include short stature, ear abnormalities and hearing loss, heart defects, presence of an extra (duplicated) thumb, and abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary system.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Head Lice ?,"Head lice are parasitic wingless insects. They live on people's heads and feed on their blood. An adult louse is about the size of a sesame seed. The eggs, called nits, are even smaller - about the size of a knot in thread. Lice and nits are found on or near the scalp, most often at the neckline and behind the ears.    Lice spread by close person-to-person contact. It is possible, but not common, to get lice by sharing personal belongings such as hats or hairbrushes. Children ages 3-11 and their families get head lice most often. Personal hygiene has nothing to do with getting head lice. Head lice do not spread disease.    Symptoms are        - Tickling feeling in the hair    - Frequent itching    - Sores from scratching    - Irritability and difficulty sleeping. Head lice are most active in the dark.       Treatment is recommended for people who have an active infestation of head lice. All household members and other close contacts should be checked and treated if necessary.

Most miscarriages occur very early in the pregnancy, often before a woman even knows she is pregnant. There are many different causes for a miscarriage. In most cases, there is nothing you can do to prevent a miscarriage.    Factors that may contribute to miscarriage include       - A genetic problem with the fetus. This is the most common cause in the first trimester.    - Problems with the uterus or cervix. These contribute in the second trimester.    - Polycystic ovary syndrome       Signs of a miscarriage can include vaginal spotting or bleeding, abdominal pain or cramping, and fluid or tissue passing from the vagina. Although vaginal bleeding is a common symptom of miscarriage, many women have spotting early in their pregnancy but do not miscarry. But if you are pregnant and have bleeding or spotting, contact your health care provider immediately.    Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not need any treatment. In some cases, you may need a procedure called a dilatation and curettage (D&C) to remove tissue remaining in the uterus.    Counseling may help you cope with your grief.

Miscarriage is also called spontaneous abortion. It is not the same as a stillbirth, which is the loss of a baby after 20 weeks of pregnancy.    Miscarriage is common. About 10 to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. The risk of miscarriage increases with age. Women in their 20s have a 10 to 20 percent chance of having a miscarriage. Women in their 40s have a 40 to 60 percent chance.    Miscarriage is usually caused by a problem in the developing embryo or a problem in the way the placenta, the organ that nourishes the embryo, is formed. Most miscarriages are not caused by something the woman did or did not do.    If you have a miscarriage, you may have vaginal bleeding and cramping that is worse than normal menstrual cramps. You may pass tissue that looks like thick blood clots or clumps of tissue. You may also pass"
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) COG5-congenital disorder of glycosylation ?,"COG5-congenital disorder of glycosylation (COG5-CDG, formerly known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIi) is an inherited condition that causes neurological problems and other abnormalities. The pattern and severity of this disorder's signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals.  Individuals with COG5-CDG typically develop signs and symptoms of the condition during infancy. These individuals often have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and delayed development. Other neurological features include moderate to severe intellectual disability, poor coordination, and difficulty walking. Some affected individuals never learn to speak. Other features of COG5-CDG include short stature, an unusually small head size (microcephaly), and distinctive facial features, which can include ears that are set low and rotated backward, a short neck with a low hairline in the back, and a prominent nose. Less commonly, affected individuals can have hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), vision impairment, damage to the nerves that control bladder function (a condition called neurogenic bladder), liver disease, and joint deformities (contractures).","COG5-congenital disorder of glycosylation (COG5-CDG) is a rare inherited disorder that affects the way the body makes a specific type of sugar molecule. This sugar molecule is called N-glycan. N-glycans are attached to proteins and play a role in the normal function of many organs and tissues in the body. COG5-CDG is caused by mutations in the COG5 gene. The COG5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a complex called the dolichol phosphate mannose (DPM) pathway. The DPM pathway is involved in the production of N-glycans. Mutations in the COG5 gene disrupt the function of the COG5 protein, which impairs the DPM pathway and reduces the amount of N-glycans produced. The lack of N-glycans leads to the signs and symptoms of COG5-CDG.  COG5-CDG is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. Other features may include liver disease, kidney problems, and problems with the blood vessels that supply the brain (c"
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Sleep Disorders ?,"Is it hard for you to fall asleep or stay asleep through the night?

This condition alters the levels of several substances in the body, including phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) that is obtained through the diet. It is found in foods that contain protein and in some artificial sweeteners. High levels of phenylalanine are present from early infancy in people with untreated tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. This condition also alters the levels of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain.  Infants with tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency appear normal at birth, but medical problems ranging from mild to severe become apparent over time. Signs and symptoms of this condition can include intellectual disability, progressive problems with development, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, seizures, behavioral problems, and an inability to control body temperature.","Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to make a substance called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). This substance is necessary for the body to make certain chemicals that are important for normal growth and development. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including seizures, developmental delay, and problems with movement and coordination. It can also cause a skin condition called pellagra, which is characterized by skin rashes, diarrhea, and other symptoms. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency is caused by mutations in the genes that make the enzymes needed to make tetrahydrobiopterin. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to have the disorder. Treatment for tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency typically involves taking supplements of tetrahydrobiopterin or related compounds."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) optic atrophy type 1 ?,"Optic atrophy type 1 is a condition that affects vision. Individuals with this condition have progressive vision loss that typically begins within the first decade of life. The severity of the vision loss varies widely among affected people, even among members of the same family. People with this condition can range from having nearly normal vision to complete blindness. The vision loss usually progresses slowly.  People with optic atrophy type 1 frequently have problems with color vision that make it difficult or impossible to distinguish between shades of blue and green. Other vision problems associated with this condition include a progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor) of the nerve that relays visual information from the eye to the brain (optic nerve). Optic nerve pallor can be detected during an eye examination.","Optic atrophy type 1 is a rare inherited disorder that causes progressive vision loss. It is characterized by the degeneration of the optic nerve, which is the nerve that carries visual information from the eye to the brain. The condition is caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Treatment for long QT syndrome depends on the underlying cause and may include medications, dietary changes, and avoidance of certain triggers."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Infectious Arthritis ?,"Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body. Symptoms of infectious arthritis include       - Intense pain in the joint    - Joint redness and swelling    - Chills and fever    - Inability to move the area with the infected joint       One type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. Sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. In women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.    To diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.","Infectious arthritis is inflammation of the joints caused by an infection. The infection can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Infectious arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but it most commonly affects the knees, ankles, hips, and wrists. Infectious arthritis can be acute (sudden onset) or chronic (long-lasting). Acute infectious arthritis is usually caused by bacteria, while chronic infectious arthritis is usually caused by fungi. Infectious arthritis can be very serious and can cause permanent joint damage if not treated promptly."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Skin Pigmentation Disorders ?,"Pigmentation means coloring. Skin pigmentation disorders affect the color of your skin. Your skin gets its color from a pigment called melanin. Special cells in the skin make melanin. When these cells become damaged or unhealthy, it affects melanin production. Some pigmentation disorders affect just patches of skin. Others affect your entire body.     If your body makes too much melanin, your skin gets darker. Pregnancy, Addison's disease, and sun exposure all can make your skin darker. If your body makes too little melanin, your skin gets lighter. Vitiligo is a condition that causes patches of light skin. Albinism is a genetic condition affecting a person's skin. A person with albinism may have no color, lighter than normal skin color, or patchy missing skin color. Infections, blisters and burns can also cause lighter skin.","Skin pigmentation disorders are conditions that affect the color of the skin. The skin's color is determined by the amount of a pigment called melanin. Melanin is produced by cells called melanocytes. The melanocytes are found in the lower layer of the skin, called the dermis. The melanin is then transferred to skin cells called keratinocytes. The keratinocytes move to the top layer of the skin, the epidermis, where they die and give the skin its color. Skin pigmentation disorders can be caused by too much or too little melanin. They can also be caused by changes in the way melanin is made or distributed in the skin. Some skin pigmentation disorders are present at birth (congenital). Others develop later in life. Some are caused by exposure to certain substances, such as medications or chemicals. Some are caused by inflammation or injury to the skin. Some skin pigmentation disorders are harmless. Others can be a sign of an underlying disease. Some can be treated. Others cannot."
Answer this question truthfully,"What is (are) blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome ?","Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a condition that mainly affects development of the eyelids. People with this condition have a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and an upward fold of the skin of the lower eyelid near the inner corner of the eye (epicanthus inversus). In addition, there is an increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus). Because of these eyelid abnormalities, the eyelids cannot open fully, and vision may be limited.  Other structures in the eyes and face may be mildly affected by BPES. Affected individuals are at an increased risk of developing vision problems such as nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) beginning in childhood. They may also have eyes that do not point in the same direction (strabismus) or ""lazy eye"" (amblyopia) affecting one or both eyes. People with BPES may also have distinctive facial features including a broad nasal bridge, low-set ears, or a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum).  There are two types of BPES, which are distinguished by their signs and symptoms. Both types I and II include the eyelid malformations and other facial features. Type I is also associated with an early loss of ovarian function (primary ovarian insufficiency) in women, which causes their menstrual periods to become less frequent and eventually stop before age 40. Primary ovarian insufficiency can lead to difficulty conceiving a child (subfertility) or a complete inability to conceive (infertility).","Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the eyelids. The condition is characterized by the following features: 1. Blepharophimosis: This is a condition in which the eyelids are fused together, causing the eyelids to be narrow and the eyes to appear small. 2. Ptosis: This is a condition in which the upper eyelid droops, covering part of the pupil. 3. Epicanthus inversus: This is a condition in which the inner corner of the eye is turned inward. BPES is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment for BPES may include surgery to correct the eyelid abnormalities."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Degenerative Nerve Diseases ?,"Degenerative nerve diseases affect many of your body's activities, such as balance, movement, talking, breathing, and heart function. Many of these diseases are genetic. Sometimes the cause is a medical condition such as alcoholism, a tumor, or a stroke. Other causes may include toxins, chemicals, and viruses.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ?,"Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a progressive disorder that mainly affects the central nervous system (CNS). This disorder causes deterioration of white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin (the substance that protects the nerves). Most affected people begin to have signs and symptoms during childhood, but symptoms may first become apparent anywhere from before birth to adulthood. Symptoms may include difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia); muscle stiffness (spasticity); and optic atrophy. Symptoms may worsen rapidly with episodes of fever, after head trauma, or with other stresses on the body. This disorder may be caused by mutations in any of 5 genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is no specific treatment, and prognosis seems to correlate with the age of onset, the earliest forms being more severe.","Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (LVWM) is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the brain's white matter. White matter is the part of the brain that contains nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin is important for the proper functioning of the brain because it helps nerve fibers transmit signals. In LVWM, the white matter of the brain is gradually replaced by fluid-filled spaces (cavities). This process is called cavitation. The cavities cause the brain to appear abnormal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. LVWM is caused by mutations in the EIF2B2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The signs and symptoms of LVWM usually appear in early childhood and include developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and problems with movement and coordination. There is no cure for LVWM, and treatment is supportive."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Long QT syndrome 1 ?,"Romano-Ward syndrome is the most common form of inherited long QT syndrome. Symptoms include arrhythmia, fainting, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. There are six different types of this syndrome, long QT 1 through 6. Each type is caused by a change in a different gene. The most prevalent form of long QT syndrome is long QT type 1. Long QT type 1 is caused by changes in the KCNQ1 gene. Romano-Ward syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.","Long QT syndrome 1 (LQT1) is a heart rhythm disorder that can cause fast, chaotic heartbeats. These abnormal heart rhythms can potentially lead to fainting, seizures, or sudden death. LQT1 is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment may include medications to control heart rate and prevent abnormal heart rhythms, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and avoidance of certain triggers."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) combined pituitary hormone deficiency ?,"Combined pituitary hormone deficiency is a condition that causes a shortage (deficiency) of several hormones produced by the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. A lack of these hormones may affect the development of many parts of the body. The first signs of this condition include a failure to grow at the expected rate and short stature that usually becomes apparent in early childhood.  People with combined pituitary hormone deficiency may have hypothyroidism, which is underactivity of the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland in the lower neck. Hypothyroidism can cause many symptoms, including weight gain and fatigue. Other features of combined pituitary hormone deficiency include delayed or absent puberty and lack the ability to have biological children (infertility). The condition can also be associated with a deficiency of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol deficiency can impair the body's immune system, causing individuals to be more susceptible to infection.  Rarely, people with combined pituitary hormone deficiency have intellectual disability; a short, stiff neck; or underdeveloped optic nerves, which carry visual information from the eyes to the brain.","Combined pituitary hormone deficiency is a rare disorder that affects the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain that produces hormones that control growth, metabolism, and the menstrual cycle. The pituitary gland produces several hormones, including growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. In combined pituitary hormone deficiency, the pituitary gland does not produce enough of one or more of these hormones. The disorder is usually caused by a problem with the pituitary gland itself, such as a tumor or an inherited disorder. The signs and symptoms of combined pituitary hormone deficiency vary depending on which hormones are affected. Growth hormone deficiency can cause short stature, delayed puberty, and a lack of energy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency can cause fatigue, weight gain, and a slow heart rate. Adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency can cause low blood pressure, low blood sugar, and a lack of energy"
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy ?,"If you are pregnant, high blood pressure can cause problems for you and your unborn baby. You may have had high blood pressure before you got pregnant. Or you may get it once you are pregnant - a condition called gestational hypertension. Either one can cause low birth weight or premature delivery of the baby.    Controlling your blood pressure during pregnancy and getting regular prenatal care are important for the health of you and your baby. Treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy may include close monitoring of the baby, lifestyle changes, and certain medicines.    Some pregnant women with high blood pressure develop preeclampsia. It's a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It can be life-threatening for both you and the unborn baby. There is no proven way to prevent it. Most women who have signs of preeclampsia are closely monitored to lessen or avoid complications. The only way to ""cure"" preeclampsia is to deliver the baby.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute","High blood pressure in pregnancy is a condition in which a woman has high blood pressure during pregnancy. High blood pressure in pregnancy is also called gestational hypertension or pregnancy-induced hypertension. High blood pressure in pregnancy is a common problem. It can occur at any time during pregnancy. It is more common in women who have had high blood pressure before pregnancy. High blood pressure in pregnancy can cause problems for the mother and the baby. It can cause the placenta to separate from the uterus before the baby is born. This is called placental abruption. Placental abruption can cause bleeding and can be dangerous for the baby. High blood pressure in pregnancy can also cause the baby to be born too early. This is called preterm labor.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Holes in the Heart ?,"Holes in the heart are simple congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects. Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. These defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.
                
The heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. With each heartbeat, the right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body.
                
The septum prevents mixing of blood between the two sides of the heart. However, some babies are born with holes in the upper or lower septum.
                
A hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). A hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect (VSD).
                
ASDs and VSDs allow blood to pass from the left side of the heart to the right side. Thus, oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. As a result, some oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the lungs instead of the body.
                
Over the past few decades, the diagnosis and treatment of ASDs and VSDs have greatly improved. Children who have simple congenital heart defects can survive to adulthood. They can live normal, active lives because their heart defects close on their own or have been repaired.",Holes in the heart are abnormal openings in the walls that separate the chambers of the heart. These openings are called septal defects. The most common type of septal defect is a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart (atrial septal defect). Another type of septal defect is a hole between the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect). Septal defects can also occur between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. These defects are called atrioventricular septal defects. Septal defects can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in life. They can be small or large. Some septal defects are so small that they do not cause any problems. Others can cause serious health problems.
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Familial hyperinsulinism ?,"Familial hyperinsulinism is an inherited condition that causes individuals to have abnormally high levels of insulin, which leads to frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, and/or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as seizures, intellectual disability, breathing difficulties, and/or coma. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur after periods without food (fasting), episodes of hypoglycemia in people with familial hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating or exercising. Mutations in at least seven genes have been found to cause this condition. It is often inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern or less commonly, an autosomal dominant pattern.","Familial hyperinsulinism is a rare genetic disorder that causes the pancreas to produce too much insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use sugar for energy. In people with familial hyperinsulinism, the body produces too much insulin, which can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Hypoglycemia can cause a variety of symptoms, including dizziness, confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness. Familial hyperinsulinism is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, some cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Treatment for familial hyperinsulinism usually involves medications to control blood sugar levels and, in some cases, surgery to remove part of the pancreas."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) triple X syndrome ?,"Triple X syndrome, also called trisomy X or 47,XXX, is characterized by the presence of an additional X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Although females with this condition may be taller than average, this chromosomal change typically causes no unusual physical features. Most females with triple X syndrome have normal sexual development and are able to conceive children.  Triple X syndrome is associated with an increased risk of learning disabilities and delayed development of speech and language skills. Delayed development of motor skills (such as sitting and walking), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and behavioral and emotional difficulties are also possible, but these characteristics vary widely among affected girls and women. Seizures or kidney abnormalities occur in about 10 percent of affected females.","Triple X syndrome is a genetic condition in which a female has three copies of the X chromosome in each cell instead of the usual two copies. This extra genetic material causes the characteristic features of the condition. Triple X syndrome is not the same as Turner syndrome, which is caused by the absence of one X chromosome. Triple X syndrome is also different from Klinefelter syndrome, which is caused by an extra X chromosome in males. Triple X syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality in females. It is estimated to occur in 1 in 1,000 newborn girls. The majority of cases are not inherited, but occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. In rare cases, triple X syndrome can be inherited from a mother with a condition called nondisjunction. In these cases, an egg or sperm cell has an abnormal number of chromosomes. When two cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes combine, a child with an extra chromosome may result. The features of triple X syndrome can vary widely among affected individuals.

In congenital primary aphakia, the lens is absent or malformed. This condition can affect one or both eyes. The cause of congenital primary aphakia is unknown. It is not inherited. The condition is usually diagnosed at birth or in early infancy. It is often associated with other eye abnormalities, such as microphthalmia (small eyes) or coloboma (a gap or missing part in the eye). People with congenital primary aphakia usually have poor vision or blindness in the affected eye. Treatment may include surgery to implant a lens or a prosthetic device, glasses, or contact lenses."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) cutis laxa ?,"Cutis laxa is a disorder of connective tissue, which is the tissue that forms the body's supportive framework. Connective tissue provides structure and strength to the muscles, joints, organs, and skin.  The term ""cutis laxa"" is Latin for loose or lax skin, and this condition is characterized by skin that is sagging and not stretchy (inelastic). The skin often hangs in loose folds, causing the face and other parts of the body to have a droopy appearance. Extremely wrinkled skin may be particularly noticeable on the neck and in the armpits and groin.  Cutis laxa can also affect connective tissue in other parts of the body, including the heart, blood vessels, joints, intestines, and lungs. The disorder can cause heart problems and abnormal narrowing, bulging, or tearing of critical arteries. Affected individuals may have soft out-pouchings in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia) or around the belly button (umbilical hernia). Pouches called diverticula can also develop in the walls of certain organs, such as the bladder and intestines. During childhood, some people with cutis laxa develop a lung disease called emphysema, which can make it difficult to breathe. Depending on which organs and tissues are affected, the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa can range from mild to life-threatening.  Researchers have described several different forms of cutis laxa. The forms are often distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. In general, the autosomal recessive forms of cutis laxa tend to be more severe than the autosomal dominant form. In addition to the features described above, some people with autosomal recessive cutis laxa have delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, and problems with movement that can worsen over time.  The X-linked form of cutis laxa is often called occipital horn syndrome. This form of the disorder is considered a mild type of Menkes syndrome, which is a condition that affects copper levels in the body. In addition to sagging and inelastic skin, occipital horn syndrome is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose joints.","Cutis laxa is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and connective tissue. The skin is loose and inelastic, and may sag or wrinkle. The skin may also be fragile and tear easily. Cutis laxa can also affect the lungs, digestive system, and other organs. The severity of the condition varies widely, even among affected members of the same family. Cutis laxa is caused by mutations in one of several genes. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD deficiency) is an inborn error of valine (an amino acid) metabolism. The symptoms, which may not develop until later in infancy or childhood, can include failure to thrive, dilated cardiomyopathy, seizures, and anemia. IBD deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACAD8 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.","Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to break down certain fats. This disorder is characterized by episodes of metabolic acidosis, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, and coma. Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is caused by mutations in the HADHA gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment is aimed at preventing episodes of metabolic acidosis and may include a low-fat diet, carnitine supplementation, and medications to help control acidosis."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Seasonal Affective Disorder ?,"Some people experience a serious mood change during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. This condition is called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. SAD is a type of depression. It usually lifts during spring and summer.     Not everyone with SAD has the same symptoms. They include       - Sad, anxious or ""empty"" feelings    - Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism    - Feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness    - Irritability, restlessness    - Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy    - Fatigue and decreased energy    - Difficulty concentrating, remembering details and making decisions    - Difficulty sleeping or oversleeping    - Changes in weight    - Thoughts of death or suicide       SAD may be effectively treated with light therapy. But nearly half of people with SAD do not respond to light therapy alone. Antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can reduce SAD symptoms, either alone or combined with light therapy.    NIH: National Institute of Mental Health","Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that's related to changes in seasons — SAD begins and ends at about the same times every year. If you're like most people with SAD, your symptoms start in the fall and continue into the winter months, sapping your energy and making you feel moody. Less often, SAD causes depression in the spring or early summer. The symptoms are similar to those of major depression, but they tend to be less severe."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia ?,"Dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia is a condition that affects blood cells and primarily occurs in males. A main feature of this condition is a type of anemia called dyserythropoietic anemia, which is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells. The term ""dyserythropoietic"" refers to the abnormal red blood cell formation that occurs in this condition. In affected individuals, immature red blood cells are unusually shaped and cannot develop into functional mature cells, leading to a shortage of healthy red blood cells. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have another blood disorder characterized by a reduced level of circulating platelets (thrombocytopenia). Platelets are cell fragments that normally assist with blood clotting. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. While people with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have signs and symptoms of both blood disorders, some are primarily affected by anemia, while others are more affected by thrombocytopenia.  The most severe cases of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia are characterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. For many others, the signs and symptoms of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia begin in infancy. People with this condition experience prolonged bleeding or bruising after minor trauma or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Anemia can cause pale skin, weakness, and fatigue. Severe anemia may create a need for frequent blood transfusions to replenish the supply of red blood cells; however, repeated blood transfusions over many years can cause health problems such as excess iron in the blood. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia may also have a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia), which can make them prone to recurrent infections. Additionally, they may have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). The severity of these abnormalities varies among affected individuals.  Some people with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia have additional blood disorders such as beta thalassemia or congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Beta thalassemia is a condition that reduces the production of hemoglobin, which is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A decrease in hemoglobin can lead to a shortage of oxygen in cells and tissues throughout the body. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is another disorder that impairs hemoglobin production. People with congenital erythropoietic porphyria are also very sensitive to sunlight, and areas of skin exposed to the sun can become fragile and blistered.","Dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia is a rare blood disorder characterized by abnormal red blood cell (RBC) production and low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia). The condition is caused by mutations in the EPO gene, which produces a protein called erythropoietin. This protein is necessary for the production of RBCs. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The severity of the condition varies among affected individuals. Some people may have mild symptoms, while others may have severe symptoms that require frequent blood transfusions. Treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms and preventing complications."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Family Issues ?,"There are many kinds of families. Some have two parents, while others have a single parent. Sometimes there is no parent and grandparents raise grandchildren. Some children live in foster families, adoptive families, or in stepfamilies.    Families are much more than groups of people who share the same genes or the same address. They should be a source of love and support. This does not mean that everyone gets along all the time. Conflicts are a part of family life. Many things can lead to conflict, such as illness, disability, addiction, job loss, school problems, and marital issues. Listening to each other and working to resolve conflicts are important in strengthening the family.","Family issues are problems that arise within a family. These problems can be caused by a variety of factors, including communication problems, financial difficulties, and changes in family structure. Family issues can be difficult to deal with, but they are important to address in order to maintain a healthy family dynamic.

Progressive painful intermittent muscle spasms usually start between 6 to 15 years of age. Alopecia universalis also appears around age 10. About half of affected individuals experience malabsorption, specifically of carbohydrates. The skeletal abnormalities may be secondary to muscle spasms. The main endocrine disorder is primary amenorrhea. All cases have apparently been sporadic, even when occurring in large families. The exact cause is unknown; but some researchers have speculated that Satoyoshi syndrome is an autoimmune disorder.","Satoyoshi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the following symptoms: 1.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) epidermolytic hyperkeratosis ?,"Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is a skin disorder that is present at birth. Affected babies may have very red skin (erythroderma) and severe blisters. Because newborns with this disorder are missing the protection provided by normal skin, they are at risk of becoming dehydrated and developing infections in the skin or throughout the body (sepsis).  As affected individuals get older, blistering is less frequent, erythroderma becomes less evident, and the skin becomes thick (hyperkeratotic), especially over joints, on areas of skin that come into contact with each other, or on the scalp or neck. This thickened skin is usually darker than normal. Bacteria can grow in the thick skin, often causing a distinct odor.  Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis can be categorized into two types. People with PS-type epidermolytic hyperkeratosis have thick skin on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet (palmoplantar or palm/sole hyperkeratosis) in addition to other areas of the body. People with the other type, NPS-type, do not have extensive palmoplantar hyperkeratosis but do have hyperkeratosis on other areas of the body.  Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is part of a group of conditions called ichthyoses, which refers to the scaly skin seen in individuals with related disorders. However, in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, the skin is thick but not scaly as in some of the other conditions in the group.","Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is a rare inherited skin disorder characterized by thick, scaly skin. The condition is caused by mutations in the KRT9 or KRT16 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The severity of the condition varies widely among affected individuals. Mild cases may only cause thickening of the skin on the palms and soles, while more severe cases can cause thickening of the skin on the entire body, including the scalp, face, and genitalia. The skin may also be painful and itchy. In some cases, the condition can cause blistering and skin infections. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and may include topical creams, emollients, and keratolytics."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Cardiac Arrest ?,"The heart has an internal electrical system that controls the rhythm of the heartbeat. Problems can cause abnormal heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. There are many types of arrhythmia. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or it can stop beating. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when the heart develops an arrhythmia that causes it to stop beating. This is different than a heart attack, where the heart usually continues to beat but blood flow to the heart is blocked.     There are many possible causes of SCA. They include coronary heart disease, physical stress, and some inherited disorders. Sometimes there is no known cause for the SCA.    Without medical attention, the person will die within a few minutes. People are less likely to die if they have early defibrillation. Defibrillation sends an electric shock to restore the heart rhythm to normal. You should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.    If you have had an SCA, an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chance of dying from a second SCA.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute","Cardiac arrest is a sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. It is a medical emergency. Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack. During a heart attack, blood flow to the heart is blocked, but the heart can still beat. During cardiac arrest, the heart stops beating and blood is not pumped to the brain or other vital organs. Cardiac arrest is fatal if not treated immediately. The most common cause of cardiac arrest is a problem with the heart's electrical system. Other causes include heart disease, heart attack, and drowning. Cardiac arrest can happen to anyone, at any age. It is more common in people who have heart disease or other risk factors. Symptoms of cardiac arrest include sudden collapse, no pulse, no breathing, and no response to shaking or tapping. If you suspect someone is having a cardiac arrest, call 911 immediately. Start CPR if you are trained."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) tyrosinemia ?,"Tyrosinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by disruptions in the multistep process that breaks down the amino acid tyrosine, a building block of most proteins. If untreated, tyrosine and its byproducts build up in tissues and organs, which can lead to serious health problems.  There are three types of tyrosinemia, which are each distinguished by their symptoms and genetic cause. Tyrosinemia type I, the most severe form of this disorder, is characterized by signs and symptoms that begin in the first few months of life. Affected infants fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) due to poor food tolerance because high-protein foods lead to diarrhea and vomiting. Affected infants may also have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), a cabbage-like odor, and an increased tendency to bleed (particularly nosebleeds). Tyrosinemia type I can lead to liver and kidney failure, softening and weakening of the bones (rickets), and an increased risk of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Some affected children have repeated neurologic crises that consist of changes in mental state, reduced sensation in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), abdominal pain, and respiratory failure. These crises can last from 1 to 7 days. Untreated, children with tyrosinemia type I often do not survive past the age of 10.  Tyrosinemia type II can affect the eyes, skin, and mental development. Signs and symptoms often begin in early childhood and include eye pain and redness, excessive tearing, abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia), and thick, painful skin on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis). About 50 percent of individuals with tyrosinemia type II have some degree of intellectual disability.  Tyrosinemia type III is the rarest of the three types. The characteristic features of this type include intellectual disability, seizures, and periodic loss of balance and coordination (intermittent ataxia).  About 10 percent of newborns have temporarily elevated levels of tyrosine (transient tyrosinemia). In these cases, the cause is not genetic. The most likely causes are vitamin C deficiency or immature liver enzymes due to premature birth.","Tyrosinemia is a rare inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to break down a protein building block called tyrosine. Tyrosine is an amino acid that is found in many foods, including dairy products, eggs, fish, meat, nuts, and soybeans. Tyrosine is also produced in the body from another amino acid called phenylalanine. Tyrosine is important for the production of certain hormones, neurotransmitters, and proteins. Tyrosinemia is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme called fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). This enzyme is needed to break down tyrosine. Without enough FAH, tyrosine builds up in the body and can cause serious health problems. There are three types of tyrosinemia: type I, type II, and type III. Type I tyrosinemia is the most common and most severe form of the disorder. It is caused by a complete lack of FAH activity. Type II tyrosinemia is caused by a partial deficiency of FAH activity. Type III tyrosinemia is caused by a deficiency of"
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Macrodactyly of the hand ?,"Macrodactyly of the hand is a rare condition in which a person's fingers are abnormally large due to the overgrowth of the underlying bone and soft tissue. This condition is congenital, meaning that babies are born with it. Although babies are born with the condition, macrodactyly is usually not inherited. Most of the time, only one hand is affected, but usually more than one finger is involved. Macrodactyly may also coexist with syndactyly, a condition in which two fingers are fused together. Although it is a benign condition, macrodactyly is deforming and can look cosmetically displeasing. Surgery, usually involving multiple procedures, can help the problem.",Macrodactyly of the hand is a rare congenital condition characterized by an abnormally large digit. The affected digit may be enlarged in all three dimensions (macrodactyly) or only in length (macromesodactyly). The condition may be isolated or associated with other congenital anomalies.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Alpers' Disease ?,"Alpers' disease is a progressive, neurodevelopmental, mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome characterized by three co-occurring clinical symptoms: psychomotor regression (dementia); seizures; and liver disease. It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutation in the gene for the mitochondrial DNA polymerase POLG. The disease occurs in about one in 100,000 persons. Most individuals with Alpers' disease do not show symptoms at birth and develop normally for weeks to years before the onset of symptoms. Diagnosis is established by testing for the POLG gene. Symptoms typically occur months before tissue samples show the mitochondrial DNA depletion, so that these depletion studies cannot be used for early diagnosis. About 80 percent of individuals with Alpers' disease develop symptoms in the first two years of life, and 20 percent develop symptoms between ages 2 and 25. The first symptoms of the disorder are usually nonspecific and may include hypoglycemia secondary to underlying liver disease, failure to thrive, infection-associated encephalopathy, spasticity, myoclonus (involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles), seizures, or liver failure. An increased protein level is seen in cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Cortical blindness (loss of vision due to damage to the area of the cortex that controls vision) develops in about 25 percent of cases. Gastrointestinal dysfunction and cardiomyopathy may occur. Dementia is typically episodic and often associated with an infection that occurs while another disease is in process. Seizures may be difficult to control and unrelenting seizures can cause developmental regression as well. ""Alpers-like"" disorders without liver disease are genetically different and have a different clinical course. Fewer than one-third of individuals with the ""Alpers-like"" phenotype without liver disease have POLG mutations.","Alpers' disease is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the nervous system. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the brain and spinal cord, liver disease, and muscle weakness. The disease is caused by a mutation in the POLG gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called polymerase gamma. This enzyme is involved in the production of energy in cells. The mutation leads to a shortage of the enzyme, which causes the cells in the nervous system, liver, and muscles to malfunction and die. Alpers' disease is usually diagnosed in children between the ages of 2 and 5. The disease progresses rapidly, and most children with Alpers' disease die within a few years of diagnosis. There is no cure for Alpers' disease, and treatment is focused on managing the symptoms."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) DICER1 syndrome ?,"DICER1 syndrome is an inherited disorder that increases the risk of a variety of cancerous and noncancerous (benign) tumors, most commonly certain types of tumors that occur in the lungs, kidneys, ovaries, and thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck). Affected individuals can develop one or more types of tumors, and members of the same family can have different types. However, the risk of tumor formation in individuals with DICER1 syndrome is only moderately increased compared with tumor risk in the general population; most individuals with genetic changes associated with this condition never develop tumors.  People with DICER1 syndrome who develop tumors most commonly develop pleuropulmonary blastoma, which is characterized by tumors that grow in lung tissue or in the outer covering of the lungs (the pleura). These tumors occur in infants and young children and are rare in adults. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is classified as one of three types on the basis of tumor characteristics: in type I, the growths are composed of air-filled pockets called cysts; in type II, the growths contain both cysts and solid tumors (or nodules); and in type III, the growth is a solid tumor that can fill a large portion of the chest. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is considered cancerous, and types II and III can spread (metastasize), often to the brain, liver, or bones. Individuals with pleuropulmonary blastoma may also develop an abnormal accumulation of air in the chest cavity that can lead to the collapse of a lung (pneumothorax).  Cystic nephroma, which involves multiple benign fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, can also occur; in people with DICER1 syndrome, the cysts develop early in childhood.  DICER1 syndrome is also associated with tumors in the ovaries known as Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, which typically develop in affected women in their teens or twenties. Some Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors release the male sex hormone testosterone; in these cases, affected women may develop facial hair, a deep voice, and other male characteristics. Some affected women have irregular menstrual cycles. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors usually do not metastasize.  People with DICER1 syndrome are also at risk of multinodular goiter, which is enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by the growth of multiple fluid-filled or solid tumors (both referred to as nodules). The nodules are generally slow-growing and benign. Despite the growths, the thyroid's function is often normal. Rarely, individuals with DICER1 syndrome develop thyroid cancer (thyroid carcinoma).","DICER1 syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many body systems. It is caused by mutations in the DICER1 gene. The DICER1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the production of small RNA molecules called microRNAs. These molecules help regulate gene activity by blocking the production of certain proteins. Mutations in the DICER1 gene lead to the production of an abnormal DICER1 protein that cannot function properly. The resulting decrease in microRNA production leads to the overproduction of certain proteins, which can cause the signs and symptoms of DICER1 syndrome.  DICER1 syndrome is characterized by the development of tumors in many parts of the body. The most common tumors associated with this condition are cystic nephroma, which occurs in the kidneys, and pleuropulmonary blastoma, which occurs in the lungs. Other tumors that can occur in people with DICER1 syndrome include thyroid cancer, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, and cystic fibrosis-like disease. In addition to tumors, DICER1 syndrome can also cause other health problems, including"
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Neurogenic diabetes insipidus ?,"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is a disease that causes frequent urination. This type of diabetes insipidus results from damage to the pituitary gland, which disrupts the normal storage and release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When this hormone reaches the kidneys, it directs them to make less urine. Damage to the pituitary gland can be caused by different diseases as well as by head injuries, neurosurgery, or genetic disorders. To treat the ADH deficiency that results from any kind of damage to the pituitary, a synthetic hormone called desmopressin can be taken by an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill.","Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is a rare disorder that causes the body to produce too little antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is a hormone that helps control the amount of water in the body. Without enough ADH, the kidneys produce large amounts of dilute urine. This leads to excessive thirst and dehydration. Neurogenic diabetes insipidus can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. It can also be caused by genetic mutations. Treatment involves replacing the missing ADH."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ?,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a disorder that results in the development of multiple abnormalities in the blood vessels.  In the circulatory system, blood carrying oxygen from the lungs is normally pumped by the heart into the arteries at high pressure. The pressure allows the blood to make its way through the arteries to the smaller vessels (arterioles and capillaries) that supply oxygen to the body's tissues. By the time blood reaches the capillaries, the pressure is much lower. The blood then proceeds from the capillaries into veins, through which it eventually returns to the heart.  In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, some arterial vessels flow directly into veins rather than into the capillaries. These abnormalities are called arteriovenous malformations. When they occur in vessels near the surface of the skin, where they are visible as red markings, they are known as telangiectases (the singular is telangiectasia).  Without the normal buffer of the capillaries, the blood moves from the arteries at high pressure into the thinner walled, less elastic veins. The extra pressure tends to strain and enlarge these blood vessels, and may result in compression or irritation of adjacent tissues and frequent episodes of severe bleeding (hemorrhage). Nosebleeds are very common in people with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and more serious problems may arise from hemorrhages in the brain, liver, lungs, or other organs.  Forms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia include type 1, type 2, type 3, and juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. People with type 1 tend to develop symptoms earlier than those with type 2, and are more likely to have blood vessel malformations in the lungs and brain. Type 2 and type 3 may be associated with a higher risk of liver involvement. Women are more likely than men to develop blood vessel malformations in the lungs with type 1, and are also at higher risk of liver involvement with both type 1 and type 2. Individuals with any form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, however, can have any of these problems.  Juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome is a condition that involves both arteriovenous malformations and a tendency to develop growths (polyps) in the gastrointestinal tract. Types 1, 2 and 3 do not appear to increase the likelihood of such polyps.","Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal blood vessels to grow in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. These abnormal blood vessels are called telangiectasias. Telangiectasias are small, spidery blood vessels that are visible on the skin and mucous membranes. They are most commonly found on the face, lips, fingers, and toes. Telangiectasias in the nose and mouth can cause nosebleeds and bleeding from the gums. Telangiectasias in the lungs can cause shortness of breath and coughing up blood. HHT can also cause anemia, which is a condition in which the body does not have enough red blood cells. HHT is caused by mutations in the ENG or ACVRL1 genes. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that having a mutation in only one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is enough to cause the disorder."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Lamellar ichthyosis ?,"Lamellar ichthyosis is a rare genetic condition that affects the skin. Infants affected by lamellar ichthyosis are generally born with a shiny, waxy layer of skin (called a collodian membrane) that is typically shed within the first two weeks of life.

Other signs and symptoms of the condition may include ectropion, lips that turn outwards, hair loss, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis (thick skin on the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet), nail abnormalities, dehydration and respiratory problems. Although the condition may be caused by changes (mutations) in one of several different genes, approximately 90% of cases are caused by mutations in the TGM1 gene. Lamellar ichthyosis is generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Periventricular Leukomalacia ?,"Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is characterized by the death of the white matter of the brain due to softening of the brain tissue. It can affect fetuses or newborns; premature babies are at the greatest risk of the disorder. PVL is caused by a lack of oxygen or blood flow to the periventricular area of the brain, which results in the death or loss of brain tissue. The periventricular area-the area around the spaces in the brain called ventricles-contains nerve fibers that carry messages from the brain to the body's muscles. Although babies with PVL generally have no outward signs or symptoms of the disorder, they are at risk for motor disorders, delayed mental development, coordination problems, and vision and hearing impairments. PVL may be accompanied by a hemorrhage or bleeding in the periventricular-intraventricular area (the area around and inside the ventricles), and can lead to cerebral palsy. The disorder is diagnosed by ultrasound of the head.","Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a type of brain injury that occurs in premature infants. It is caused by damage to the white matter of the brain, which is the part of the brain that contains nerve fibers. PVL is most often caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain, which can occur during labor and delivery or in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). PVL can cause a variety of problems, including cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and seizures. It is a leading cause of cerebral palsy in premature infants."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Dentinogenesis imperfecta ?,"Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a condition that results in issues with tooth development, causing the teeth to be translucent and discolored (most often a blue-gray or yellow-brown in color). Individuals with this disorder tend to have teeth that are weaker than normal which leads to increased wear, breakage, and loss of the teeth. This can affect both primary (baby) and permanent teeth. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the DSPP gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There are three types of dentinogenesis imperfecta. Type I: occurs in people who have osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition in which bones are brittle, causing them to break easily. Type II and type III: usually occur in people without another inherited disorder. Some families with type II also have progressive hearing loss. Type III was first identified in a population in Brandywine, Maryland. Some researchers believe that dentinogenesis imperfecta type II and type III, along with a similar condition called dentin dysplasia type II, are actually just different forms of a single disorder.","Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a rare inherited disorder that affects the development of the teeth. It is characterized by the presence of discolored, brittle, and poorly formed teeth. The teeth are often misshapen and may be lost early. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the DSPP gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is aimed at preventing tooth loss and improving the appearance of the teeth."
Answer this question truthfully,What is (are) Kidney Diseases ?,"Your kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fists. They are located near the middle of your back, just below the rib cage. Inside each kidney about a million tiny structures called nephrons filter blood. They remove waste products and extra water, which become urine. The urine flows through tubes called ureters to your bladder, which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom.     Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems, injuries, or medicines. You are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or a close family member with kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years. Other kidney problems include:       - Cancer    - Cysts    - Stones    - Infections       Your doctor can run tests to find out if you have kidney disease. If your kidneys fail completely, a kidney transplant or dialysis can replace the work your kidneys normally do.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases","Kidney diseases are a group of conditions that affect the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine until it is passed through urination. The kidneys perform many important functions, including:
- Filtering waste and extra water from the blood to make urine
- Helping to control blood pressure
- Producing hormones that help make red blood cells and that help the body use vitamin D
- Keeping the bones strong by producing a hormone that regulates the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood
- Regulating the body's fluid balance
- Regulating the acid-base balance in the blood
- Activating vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium
- Helping to control blood"
